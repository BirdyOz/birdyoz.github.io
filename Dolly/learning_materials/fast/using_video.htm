    <h1>Using video </h1>

      <p class="note">Clips from camcorders with desktop  editing</p>
      <p>With the availability of  high-quality digital videocameras, cheap recording and storage media and  consumer-level software capable of quality editing on the desktop, video has  become an affordable option for enhancing e-learning material. Enthusiastic  individual trainers can achieve good results, or development teams can prepare  quality content on a budget.</p>
      <p>Adding video to your e-learning materials can  really make them engaging and provide an alternative to the &quot;sit and read  this…&quot; model that is used so often. Video meets the preferences of those  students with a predominantly auditory and visual learning style. A quick  minute or two minute video segment can get across as much information as  several screens of text.</p>
      <p>If you are going to use video make sure it is  worth it. Just having a 'talking head' may not be the most appropriate use of  the technology. Demonstrations and active scenes make best use of the medium.</p>
      <p>One of the main problems of including video,  or movie media in your resources is the size of the files and the time they  take to download. There are, however, a few ways you can overcome the download  problem. </p>
      <h2>Converting video to Flash</h2>
      <p>Converting video and digital movies to Flash  formatted files reduces their size and allows them to download at the same time  as you are viewing them. This is called progressive download. </p>
      <h3>Video to Flash conversion programs</h3>
      <p>There are a number  of programs that you can use to convert video from a range of formats to Flash  format. Flash videos can exist in two formats:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shockwave Flash (swf) </li>
        <li>Flash Video (flv). </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Videos in swf format  need to be downloaded completely before they can be viewed. Flv files can be progressively  downloaded and viewed when only a small part of the file has been downloaded.  Producing a swf video file is very simple. Creating and adding a FLV file requires  some editing of the web page to indicate which flv file the flash player is to  present to the student.</p>
      <p>When you have recorded your video on your  digital video camera, you need to download it to your computer using the  software that came with the camera. To convert the video to Flash, you need to use  a conversion program such as one of the ones listed below. During the  conversion process you will be able to select an appropriate video size and  quality. If you make the size or quality too high you will end up with large  files that take a long time to down load.</p>
      <p>If you have large video files you may  consider converting them to Flash Video (flv) format. FLV video files can be  played as progressivly downloaded files. This means you start viewing the file  when a small part has downloaded. You don’t need to wait for the whole file to  download. FLV videos need to be played from a flash player embedded in a web  page in your learning resource.</p>
      <h2>Hosting videos on a streaming video server </h2>
      <p>Another way to provide video in your  materials is to link to the video file that is located on a streaming server.  Streaming video services are provided by such sites as YouTube and TeacherTube.  These services provide you with an html tag that allows you to embed the video  in you own web pages. </p>
      <p><strong>TeacherTube</strong>  <a href="http://www.teachertube.com/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.teachertube.com</a> <br />
        TeacherTube provides an online community for  sharing instructional videos. Community members in TeacherTube can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Upload, tag and share videos worldwide.</li>
        <li>Upload support files to attach your       educational actvities, assessments, lesson plans, notes, and other file       formats to your video.</li>
        <li>Browse hundreds of videos uploaded by       community members.</li>
        <li>Find, join and create video groups to       connect with people who have similar interests.</li>
        <li>Customize the experience by subscribing       to member videos, saving favorites, and creating playlists.</li>
        <li>Integrate TeacherTube videos on websites       using video embeds or APIs.</li>
        <li>Make videos public or private - users       can elect to broadcast their videos publicly or share them privately with       those they invite.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can copy the tag for your video and paste  it into your own web page.</p>
      <p><strong>YouTube  </strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.youtube.com</a><br />
        YouTube is very similar to teacherTube but  more widely used by non-educational users.</p>
      <p>Both YouTube and TeacherTube provide a tag  that you can copy and paste into your own web page. This will embed the video  in you page so your students can see the video from the web page you create.  Here is an example html tag for embedding video from a streaming server in you  web page.</p>
    <code>&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot;  height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;<br />
  &lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot;  value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/YOUR FILE NAME HERE&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br />
  &lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot;  value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;<br />
  &lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/ YOUR  FILE NAME HERE &quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;  wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; width=&quot;425&quot;  height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;<br />
  &lt;/object&gt;</code>
	  <p>You can add other content to the web page in  which you have embedded the video to provide a context for the video or set  tasks for students to complete when they have viewed the video.</p>
      <p><strong>Google  Video</strong> <a href="http://video.google.com.au/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://video.google.com.au/</a><br />
        Google only provides you with a link to the  Google web page which displays the video and not an embedding link to place the  video in your own web page.</p>
      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Riva FLV Player </strong><a href="http://www.rivavx.com/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.rivavx.com/</a><br />
          Riva converts most common movie files into a Flash Video  (flv) format. FLV files are small and play almost as soon as they start  downloading. At present you can convert  the following video formats: AVI, MPEG, Quicktime, WMV. Riva has a number of  preset settings to make conversion very simple. Riva also allows you to crop  areas out of your video and to extract still images from your video.<br />
          To play a FLV movie  you will need to place in it a Flash Shockwave File (swf) based player. You can  download a copy of a Flash Movie player here. </li>
        <li><strong>Video to Flash Converter  </strong> <a href="http://www.geovid.com/Video_to_Flash_Converter/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.geovid.com/Video_to_Flash_Converter/</a><br />
          Video to Flash  Converter is an easy to use program for converting your AVI digital video to  SWF Flash format. Video to Flash Converter provide SWF files ready for the web  or ready to be streamed across internet connections. You have full control over  the converted Flash Video: video quality, frame rate, size, duration and other  parameters. You do not need any special programs or plugins to create SWF video  file, simply select and convert Video to swf Flash file. As you save the swf  file you can select to create an html file at the same time with the flash file  embedded in it. You can then open this page using a HTML editor and add other  content around the video presentation.</li>
