      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include online roleplays?</h2>
        <p>Online roleplays create a simulated environment allows learners to consider authentic situations in a safe environment. Learners are involved in engaging and experiential learning. </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>participants are allocated roles to act out within a scenario</li>
          <li>participants solve problems that are introduced within the course of the roleplay</li>
          <li>participants and facilitators take part in a debriefing stage, either online or in a face-to-face situation. </li>
        </ul>      <a href="roleplay.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a> </div>
      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating online roleplays </h2>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <p>In the planning and design stage the teacher/designer will have to : </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Set up scenarios. </li>
             <li>Allocate roles. Each stakeholder role will       have different issues and perspectives on the scenario. The roleplay       moderator may provide all the details of the particular role OR the       participant may be required to use research skill to find out about their       character. </li>
             <li>Consider providing selective information to       each participant. The moderator/designer may provide some participants       with 'secret' information which is not available to all participants. This       creates hierarchies and tensions within the roleplays. </li>
             <li>Provide resource materials for learners to       manipulate and research. The website or Learning Management System used       for the roleplay may include a section with useful resources for each       character to access. These can include a variety       of content and character information that can take the form of videos,       podcasts and web-based content.</li>
             <li>provide a range of communication tools for the       participants to communicate both synchronously and asynchronously (<a href="discussions.htm">discussion</a> forums, private topics, <a href="chat.htm">chats</a>, <a href="email.htm">emails</a>,       <a href="wikis.htm">wikis</a>, <a href="blogs.htm">blogs</a>). </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The effectiveness of the roleplay will also largely depend on the debriefing stage. Following the roleplay timeline the teacher spends significant time in the online debriefing . This may take more time than the actual roleplay. The debriefing session can happen face-to-face or within an online <a href="discussions.htm">discussion</a> forum or <a href="virtual_classroom.htm">virtual classroom</a>. Some questions you may wish to ask during the debriefing phase are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How did you feel during the roleplay? </li>
          <li>What did you learn? </li>
          <li>Did you form any alliances? </li>
          <li>Did you need to compromise? </li>
          <li>What sort of communication skills did you need to use? </li>
          <li>What did you learn about the subject matter of the roleplay? </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional resources to assist  in the development of role plays are available at <a href="http://www.learningdesigns.uow.edu.au/guides/info/G1/index.htm" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.learningdesigns.uow.edu.au/guides/info/G1/index.htm</a></p>
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>There are many ways that you could build assessment into the roleplay. This may include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>self assessment which is negotiated with the       learner prior to the roleplay and may involve detailing the skills,       attributes and capacities that the learner will attempt to demonstrate       during the course of the roleplay </li>
          <li>teacher assessment based on a predetermined       rubric of skills and knowledge </li>
          <li>Use of <a href="http://www.learningdesigns.uow.edu.au/tools/info/T2/index.html">Online       Self and Peer Assessment Tools</a> </li>
          <li>reflective <a href="journals.htm">journal</a> or blog by learners on the roleplay       experience. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>The roleplay takes place in either a dedicated roleplay software package, such as Fabulusi, or in a learning platform such as Blackboard or WebCT which can be configured to creat the roleplay environment. Often these software packages are set up to replicate the proposed environment and include spaces that allow for different types of communication between participants. These may include coffee shops, libraries, newspaper offices, Human Resources department etc. If you are using a learning management system you can creat these spaces in the <a href="discussions.htm">discussion</a> forum. </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Facilitators of online roleplays will need to have skills in a range of areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>development of roles, scenarios, assessment       criteria </li>
             <li>online moderation and facilitation skills </li>
             <li>ability to develop an online environment to       host the roleplay </li>
             <li>Online Self and Peer Assessment frameworks </li>
             <li>debriefing skills. </li>
        </ul>
