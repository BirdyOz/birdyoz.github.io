      <div id="why">
      <h2>Why include virtual classrooms?</h2>
      <p>For many people the experience of teaching and learning online has been a particularly isolated and isolating one. Virtual classroom technologies offer you opportunities to providing a more human, real time interaction. It is possible to give learners a sense of intimacy with you, their teacher, and fellow learners. It also allows you to offer immediate support and counselling to learners. Finally these technologies allow you to build  greater interactivity into your online learning programs and to include remote experts in the delivery.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>usually include live audio and text       communication between trainers and learners. Participants use headsets to       communicate through audio</li>
           <li>A variety of commercial and free tools are available (see below) </li>
           <li>can include graphic material like PowerPoint slides which is broadcast to all participants. </li>
           <li>Can include the running of polls to gain input or feedback from them </li>
           <li>Enables trainers control of the microphone or &ldquo;first in best       voiced&rdquo; settings depending on formality of session </li>
           <li>the presenter share an application (e.g. Word or Excel) running on       their desktop so that the group can work together collaboratively on a       document or other resource. The presenter can often hand over application       sharing to another member of the group </li>
           <li>may include a shared whiteboard space for text       and drawing </li>
           <li>the presenter and participants can co-browse the Web and conduct       web tours </li>
           <li>the presenter can share files with the participants. </li>
           <li>the presenters and participants can display live video<strong> </strong>from       a web cam, although the speed of the internet connection will determine       how successful or useful this is in practice </li>
           <li>allows opportunities to bring in an online       guest presenter from anywhere in the world </li>
           <li>allows trainers to co-facilitate classes </li>
           <li>may include &ldquo;break out&rdquo; rooms that enable       small group work online </li>
           <li>can be archived or recorded to       enable later reviewing of a trainer led session. </li>
           <li>Will increasing be integrated into a       learning management (for example Blackboard, Moodle or Janisons etc) or       content management system.</li>

      <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating virtual classrooms </h2>
      <p>An unlimited number and type of activities can be developed  for virtual classrooms. These may include introductory exercises,  brainstorming, <a href="conceptmap.htm">mind mapping</a>, problem sharing and solving, <a href="presentations.htm">presentation </a>of <a href="research.htm">research</a> and projects, role plays, <a href="debates.htm">debates</a>, web quests, scavenger hunts, games,  pronunciation exercises, mentoring and support etc.</p>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Select some communicative activities that       would enhance the online learning experience for your learners. </li>
           <li>Plan how this would be carried out within the       virtual classroom platform. </li>
           <li>Timetable the activities within a specific       period of time (ideally no longer than an hour between sessions)</li>
           <li>Prepare your activities and resources in       advance. Develop and organise any specific resources that will enhance       your activities (PowerPoint, website URLs, files that may be application       shared, polls, etc)</li>
           <li>Send out clear instructions to participants on       how to download the necessary software and use any associated hardware to       access the classroom (headsets, speakers, microphones etc)</li>
           <li>Send out instructions on how to use the       platform and etiquette for participation. </li>
           <li>Make sure learners can access and use the       classroom well in advance of your first scheduled session (Consider       providing come and try or orientation sessions designed to introduce the       classroom to learners)</li>
           <li>Brief your learners on how the online       classroom will operate by providing a session agenda.</li>
           <li>Provide an alternative communication strategy       (for example, a bulk email or SMS etc) in the event of connection problems       or difficulties with logging into the classroom</li>
           <li>Be prepared to manage the experience       proactively. Consider team teaching initially so that all tasks can be       adequately managed.</li>
           <li>During the session, provide time initially to       explore the features so that learners are comfortable to contribute </li>
           <li>Provide time for questions and comments by       your learners in the last 5 minutes or so of your session</li>
           <li>Provide the link to the recording of       the session to your learners for their review. </li>
        </ol>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>Depending on the type of activity chosen, it would be possible to use  the virtual classroom for assessment of such activities as presentations of  project outcomes, debates, engagement in problem solving activities. Ideally  learners should know the criteria by which their participation in the voice  activity is going to be assessed. The following rubric was designed for  assessing online discussions but could be modified for use within a virtual  classroom.</p>
      <p><a href="../../assessing/downloads/C2_assessing_discussions.doc" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Assessing Discussions</a> (Word 44KB) </p>
      <h3>Generic skills</h3>
      <p>Virtual classrooms  offer extremely rich opportunities to foster generic skills. Generic skills which may be developed include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>working in <strong>groups and teams</strong> (defining the roles in the team, crisis management, giving feedback to other team members). Virtual classrooms often have breakout rooms where groups of students can meet in real time to work on a task.</li>
        <li><strong>problem solving</strong> and offering solutions to issues posed in the discussion (developing creative and innovative solutions, applying a range of strategies to solve problems) </li>
        <li><strong>communication skills</strong> (using appropriate language for the audience, persuading effectively, sharing information, asking for clarification, agreeing and disagreeing) </li>
        <li>effective use of <strong>a range of technologies</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <p>You will need choose and assess the appropriate tool for your budget  (see Features above). Many sites have trial areas where you and your colleagues  can explore and evaluate the tools and environment.</p>
      <p>Often there are some technical difficulties in getting voice  technologies to operate efficiently within organisations. It may be necessary to negotiate with technical support staff  to allow access through firewalls or to permit java updates to be installed on  client machines.</p>
      <p>Learners operating at a distance may need support in setting up the  technology at their homes or workplaces. Also all participants will need  headphone speaker sets (inexpensive) and sound cards in their computers. If the  platform supports a video function, participants may need to have a video  camera or web cam.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
        Consider providing a practise area that contains  troubleshooting tips for using a virtual classroom &ndash; like this example from the <a href="http://www.flexiblelearning.net.au/flx/go/home/projects/2007/pid/259">Flexible Learning Framework</a>.</p>
      <p>Put in place an alternate communication strategy in the  event the technology fails during a session or if learners cannot access the  classroom &ndash; for example email, SMS, instant messaging, VoIP.</p>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>development of teaching skills for this new       environment (greeting participants, asking       questions and guiding the discussion, encouraging all participants to be       involved, managing activities, supporting lurkers etc.) </li>
