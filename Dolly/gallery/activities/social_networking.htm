      <h1>Social networking</h1>
      <p class="note"> A social network service focuses on the building and verifying of  online <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network" title="Social network">social networks</a> for communities of people who  share interests and activities, or who are interested in exploring the  interests and activities of others. <br />
        <br />
      Most social network services are primarily web  based and provide various ways for users to interact, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_chat" title="Online chat">chat</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging" title="Messaging">messaging</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email" title="Email">email</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video" title="Video">video</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_chat" title="Voice chat">voice chat</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing" title="File sharing">file sharing</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogging" title="Blogging">blogging</a>,  groups, image and video sharing and so on.</p>

    <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include social networking?</h2>
        <p>Social networking sites are  proving a central activity for younger learners, especially teenagers, although  adults are now. Such sites present opportunities for self-expression and  friendship building. Youth &quot;play time&quot; in such environments can build  skills that will be a foundation for career success in the 21st century. Many  young adults are safely and responsibly engaged in such communities.</p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Social networking provides give users the ability to draw upon implicit  or explicit connections between them and other users to do something useful.  Users can:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>create a personal or professional profile</li>
          <li>limit profile information (eg. public, private)</li>
          <li>Create public or private groups </li>
          <li>Hold group conversations (threaded discussions) </li>
          <li>block unwanted connections</li>
          <li>import friends from address book</li>
          <li>search for “friends” by name, email,  interests, gender, relationship status, etc</li>
          <li>connect with members by testimonials from  “friends”, asking for introduction, suggesting a match based on personal  interest criteria/connections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Social Networking encompasses a number of tools  that can used to develop content and communication in an interrelated  relationship. These tools are generally freely available to trainers and web  users and include blogs, wikis, podcasting, social bookmarking, virtual  conferencing as well as social network sites.</p>

      <h3>Teaching  and learning opportunities</h3>
        <p>Social networking has many educational possibilities for  building relationships:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Practicing social skills</strong>. Learners  get a chance to meet all kinds of people online. Because socialising via  technology isn't as immediate as face-to-face interactions or telephone  conversations, learners have a little more time to think about a situation  before they respond. </li>
          <li><strong>Defined/guided social interaction</strong>. While online communication technologies increasingly allow for  free-form interaction, social interaction can be narrowed (for purposes of  scope and safety). Some examples of focused interaction online include  buddy/friend lists, moderated themed chat rooms or message boards. This can  help learners build skills and confidence that will help them become more  independent as they mature.</li>
          <li><strong>Identity experimentation.</strong> A learner can create an identity online  that is different from what he normally presents. Such a learner can also find  a peer group online that appreciates this aspect of their interest/character  and explore and build on their knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>Frequent use of existing and emerging/changing technologies</strong>. Technology is evolving faster than ever before. As learners  adapt to new technologies (or new applications of existing technologies), they  will be better equipped to adapt to future technology. This will help learners  to assess the limitations/risks and strategies of communicating through these  new methods and adapt their behaviour to maintain control over their own  participation.</li>
          <li><strong>Creating private social  spaces</strong>.  Adults watch more and more public places so closely that younger learners feel  they can’t gather in groups without parents or another authority figure keeping  track of them. </li>
        </ol>
      <p>Such Strategies for social e-learning include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Co-authoring<br />
          </strong>Learners use a web-based tool to collaboratively  generate and edit content. The use of a central location or website means that  everyone is contributing to the same space.</li>
          <li><strong>Collaborative problem solving and collaborative research</strong><br />
          Learners work together to develop solutions to problems  or strategies for approaching tasks. Social software tools assist Learners to  communicate with one another easily and regularly, either in a text form or  verbally, to collaborate. </li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge sharing</strong><br />
          Learners develop shared meanings and understandings  by communicating and collaborating on projects, research or through  conversations. Social networks also enable the exploration of differences in  opinion and to build consensus amongst learners.</li>
          <li><strong>Mentoring<br />
            </strong>Professionals, experts or more experienced learners  can enter the social network space sporadically to act as guides or to provide  a broader vocational perspective for learners</li>
          <li><strong>Online peer review</strong> <br />
          Learners can submit their work or ideas via the  social network; the work is then assessed by other Learners of a similar level  of knowledge in the field and the learners comment and provides improvement  suggestions. </li>
          <li><strong>Resource making</strong> <br />
            Learners can use their social network to develop  learning resources to support future learners in their subject area. Learners  gather or create learning resources, media or web links and use social software  tools for sharing the resources amongst a group or wider community. Learners  can access other online networks for exploring resource collections assembled  by others outside their learner group. </li>
      </ol>

        <h2>Integrating Social networking</h2>
        <p>Social  networking can be used for multiple purposes. With this in mind you need to  make sure your learners are clear about the purpose of the tool you intend to  use and how to use it. All social network tools allow for regular updating. Learners are more likely to participate  if they feel a sense of ownership in the social network  you create. Learning Communities set up by Trainers  that lack this sense of ownership potentially will result in your learners  feeling less likely to feel obligated to  participate.</p>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ul>
              <li>Plan and design how the tool fits into your learning    program.</li>
              <li>Set up the tool prior to course commencement.</li>
              <li>Negotiate or define with your Learners how the tool will    be used. This could include:
              <ul>
                <li>purpose of the tool in    the learning program</li>
                <li>acceptable use and    guidelines</li>
                <li>frequency of use    required.</li>
                <li>Content to be added and    techniques for posting comments, embedding video and audio, </li>
              </ul>
			  </li>
              <li>Remind learners that many social networking tools are    designed to be <strong>publically    accessible</strong>. Learners do not need to login to view materials.    Discretion should be used when publishing private and confidential materials.    There is no control over intellectual property.</li>
              <li>Clearly define the purpose, expected outcomes and    assessment requirements (if applicable).</li>
        </ul>
                <p>Provide guidance to learners on the type of work    that should be included in the tool being used. Consider using the inbuilt    commenting feature to provide individualised feedback to all learners to    build on discussions, links and bookmarks learners post.</p>
              <p>Social networking has many educational    possibilities:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Learners to create their own profile page</li>
                <li>Learners can post messages to each other</li>
                <li>Learners can participate in a collaborative    project</li>
                <li>Learners can create and share virtual objects <br />
                  <em>(such as text, images, audio and video and other blog and wiki posts    related to their subject area)</em></li>
              </ol>
        <h3>Generic skills</h3>
           <p>Some of the generic    skills and attributes developed and assessed by social networking are as    follows: </p>
           <ul>
                  <li>effective use of <strong>technology</strong></li>
                  <li><strong>planning    and organising</strong> information</li>
                  <li>lifelong learning</li>
        </ul>
              <p>Consider building on    and extending your learners existing use of Social Network tools. Surveys of    how young people use social networking sites reveals that the following are    the most popular activities:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Posting messages</li>
                <li>Downloading music</li>
                <li>Downloading videos</li>
                <li>Uploading music</li>
                <li>Updating personal Web    sites or online profiles</li>
                <li>Posting photos</li>
                <li>Blogging</li>
                <li>Creating and sharing    virtual objects</li>
                <li>Creating new characters</li>
                <li>Participating in    collaborative projects</li>
                <li>Sending suggestions or    ideas to Web sites</li>
                <li>Submitting articles to    Web sites</li>
                <li>Creating polls, quizzes    or surveys</li>
              </ul>
              <p>There is some evidence    that young people are resistant to integrating their personal social network    sites &amp; activities with vocational<br />
                or job related uses of    social networking. Consider negotiating with your learners the locations of    tools and social network sites in developing activities to enable their    participation in your learning objectives.</p>
              <h3>Assessment notes</h3>
              <p>If using social networking in assessment you need    to:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Be clear on the    competencies, generic skills and performance criteria that need to be    demonstrated.</li>
                  <li>Ensure that guidelines    for the development, compilation and submission of the social networking tool    are clearly stated.</li>
                  <li>Consider online options    for offering feedback on the particular social networking tool being    assessed.</li>
                  <li>Encourage the use of    comments and feedback published against learners contributions by co learners    as a form of peer review that contributes to an assessment outcome</li>
                  <li>Develop an electronic proforma or rubric that will aid    in the assessment of the social networking tool. As there are a large range    of social networking tools this is sometimes difficult to frame but is    critical in ensuring a fair and valid assessment process.              </li>
        </ul>
              <h3>Technical notes</h3>
              <ul>
              <li>Social networking tools    generally don’t require specific software to be installed (other than a web    browser). They are also almost always free to use as well as easy to use.</li>
              <li>There are an enormous    number of social networking tools to choose from (see Features section    above). Whilst many of them are very similar, they do have subtle differences    in look, behaviour and functionality. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Skills</h3>
              <ul>
              <li>Good    instructional design and organizational skills will be required if you use    social network tools for learning content, collaboration and assessment.    Become familiar with the social networking tools before course commencement. </li>
              <li>Ensure    you induct the learners into sign up, use and conditions of participation.</li>
              <li>Learners    will more likely to want to network with you and co learners if you build an    online presence. Consider creating your social network slowing by setting up    a site such as a wiki, blog, podcast or ning community. Provide activities as    well as content that give a context for learning and provide incentives for    learners to return and share.</li>

          <li><strong>Connections: Social and mobile tools for enhancing learning<br />
           </strong>A learner who is connected to other learners, experts    and information services can tap into a widened pool of resources that can    vastly enhance their capabilities and understanding. The use of social    software (web 2.0) and digital mobile tools are two of the latest trends in    new teaching and learning practice that enable this connectedness and have    demonstrably positive effects on learning. <br />
