      <p><a href="games.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a></p>
	</div>
    <div id="why">
      <h2>Why include games?</h2>
      <p>Game based  learning enables learners to undertake tasks and experience situations that  would otherwise be impossible or undesirable because of cost, time, logistic or  safety factors. </p>
      <p>Online games are valuable tools  for enhancing learning particularly for learner groups who have been disengaged  and lack interest. Younger groups of learners are more likely to respond to  this teaching strategy. The range of learning games that can be applied to the  online learning environment are practically unlimited and can range from simple  practice games to highly complex and challenging competitive games. </p>
      <p>Games may require the  learner to enter and engage with a simulated environment, participate in a role  play, apply strategic problem solving skills or work within an environment with  limited resources or alongside characters with various personality traits. </p>
      <p>Games are very good at using drama, storyline,  humour and characters to create a compelling experience which, from a training  point of view, develops memory hooks and means that learners not only remember  what happened but also why it happened. </p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Games are seductive and immerse learners in a       rich visual space. </li>
           <li>Games motivate learners to win or achieve a       goal. </li>
           <li>Games immerse learners in a total experience       that is fun and which sparks creativity and emotions. </li>
           <li>Games encourage learners to think and learn in       different ways. </li>
           <li>They can be played against real people or       against the computer. </li>
           <li>They can deal with large amounts of content       and allow different levels of completion. </li>
           <li>Games encourage collaboration and post-game       discussion and debriefing. </li>
           <li>Games provide meaningful and relevant feedback       to show learners consequences of their decisions and actions. The learner       knows explicitly why a particular outcome happened and allows them to       assess different approaches to the problem in an informed way. </li>
           <li>Games are genuinely enjoyable. This leads to       longer attention spans, improved attentiveness and positive feelings.</li>

    <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating games </h2>
      <p>Developing interactive games  that appeal to learners is a complex, time consuming and costly activity.</p>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify competencies that could be addressed       by a game. </li>
           <li>Storyboard the game structure. </li>
           <li>Ensure that the game is relevant to the       learners and the teaching context. </li>
           <li>Decide on the different levels within the       game. </li>
           <li>Provide clear instructions on how to navigate       the game. </li>
           <li>Decide on where learners will be able to       interact with the game and select a path. </li>
           <li>Integrate feedback. </li>
           <li>Ensure a clear scoring mechanism and       progression through the levels. </li>
           <li>Provide opportunities for collaboration and       discussion. </li>
           <li>Provide a clear ending for the game. </li>
           <li>Make sure the game appeals to a variety of       learning styles and both male and female players. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>As games can have a multitude  of pathways through them it may be unwise to try and assess a 'correct'  solution. Rather you will need to observe and document problem-solving  approaches that learners use during the course of the game. </p>
      <p>If you are  engaging a consultant to develop a games application for your training inform  them of the assessment criteria indicators by which you will assess to evaluate  learner progress and performance. Make sure your consultant can develop your  game so that it can capture, track and report these to you in a format that is  appropriate. </p>
      <h3>Generic skills</h3>
      <p>Learners are likely to use a  number of generic skills as they work through games. They will be involved in  problem solving, critical thinking, initiative and enterprise. In addition, if  learners are involved in debriefing and negotiation with others during the game  they will be developing communication skills. </p>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <p>The development of multimedia  online games is a highly complex development task so it is likely that you will  need to bring in a development team. Teachers and trainers can offer valuable  subject matter input into the content and design phase.</p>
