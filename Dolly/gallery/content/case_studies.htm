      <div id="why">
      <h2>Why include case studies?</h2>
 <p>Online  case studies  allow learners to practice their skills and knowledge  within a controlled context.&nbsp; The purpose of using a case study within an educational environment is to present the learner with a situation that they may one day encounter in their normal work practice. Often case studies use a problem-based learning environment to assist students in becoming active, independent learners and problem solvers. They are particularly useful for learners who do not have ready access to real work-based examples.


 The situations portrayed in case studies may be ambiguous and facilitate creative problem solving requiring learners to apply  previously acquired skills and knowledge.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>Online case studies will have some of the following features: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>relevance to the learner and their context</li>
        <li>a conflict or problem which needs to be solved </li>
        <li> prompts  research and stimulates analysis from a variety of viewpoints or perspectives</li>
        <li> an engaging story line and characters </li>
        <li>use of appropriate technology to enhance the story. This may include graphics, multimedia interactions, video and audio clips, digital story telling.</li>
        </ul>
      <p><strong>Case studies add a vocational basis to  training and assessment:</strong><br />
Case studies may be a historical study  where you analyse the causes and consequences of a vocational situation and  discuss the lessons learned. Learners are outside the situation and evaluating  the actions and their consequences of original players in a past work place  situation.</p>
      <p>Case studies can also be used to enable  learners to imagine or role-play within a given workplace situation and to make  informed and research suggestions on overcoming a central issue at the  workplace.</p>
      <p>Case Studies can also be problem  orientated where learners are required to solve a problem by engaging with a  work place problem or issue that requires a solution. </p>
      <p>Case should use real or believable situations and contexts  to ensure maximum engagement by learners.</p>

      <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating case studies </h2>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <p>To design a case study you will need to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Decide on the type of case study which would develop the required skills and knowledge in your learners</li>
        <li>Map out the key features and story line.</li>
        <li>Decide on the best delivery medium for the case study (text, audio, video, decision making tree etc) </li>
        <li>Develop the elements of the case study using the appropriate technology.</li>
        <li>Develop strategies for drawing out the learning (discussion, roleplay, chat, presentation).</li>
        <li>Prepare support materials for learners to ensure that they understand what they need to do with the case study. </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>The use of case studies is common within the vocational education and training (VET) sector. They can be effectively used for assessment but learners need clear guidelines outlining what is required of them and how they will be assessed. </p>
      <h3>Generic skills </h3>
      <p>Online case studies have the potential to develop and foster generic skills. Often learners contribute (either in teams or individually) to discussion boards outlining their views or solutions to the case study. This may involve the following generic skills: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>planning and organising</strong> (gathering information, interpreting data, synthesising issues)</li>
        <li>working in pairs or <strong>teams</strong> in private threads (defining the roles in the team, crisis management, giving feedback to other team members)</li>
        <li><strong>problem solving</strong> and offering solutions to issues posed in the discussion (identifying problems, developing creative and innovative solutions, applying a range of strategies to solve problems, exercising and making judgements) </li>
        <li><strong>communication skills</strong> (writing which is appropriate to the audience, persuading effectively, sharing information, asking for clarification, agreeing and disagreeing,) </li>
        <li>effective use of <strong>technology</strong>. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <p>Case studies online may be simply text based or may involve the use of a range of multimedia options. If you choose to include multimedia you may need to engage developers to assist you in the development of elements. </p>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>You will need to be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>develop appropriate case study scenarios.</li>
        <li>develop the elements of the case study using appropriate technologies (this may be outsourced).</li>
        </ul>
      <p>You will need strong skills in building narratives,  creating characters and scenarios. It may assist you to take the basis of the  case study from real life, for example a workplace or life situation you have  observed or been involved in. </p>
      <p>Case Studies can contain many narrative  steps and each step may&nbsp; end with a  problems and issue for discussion. There may not be a clear cut off point to  these issues. Provide direction as to where the case study is completed.</p>
      <p>Ensure the Case Study provides sufficient  information for the learners to engage with the problem and the issues you want  them to address.</p>
      <p>Case Studies must be believable for the learner especially  the setting, personalities, sequence of events, problems and conflicts you  develop for them to work through.</p>
