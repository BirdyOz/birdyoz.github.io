              diverse range of instructional design and facilitation strategies
            are emerging as alternatives to content-focused courseware designed
            for
                self-paced independent learning. This paper explores improvisation
                as one such emergence. We have been using improvisation as a
            fast, cheap and effective strategy to adapt, re-use and continually
            improve
                over 20 instructional templates. Designed for technologies like
            email, forums and chat, these templates aim to facilitate different
            types
          of collaborative learning across a broad range of contexts.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Outstanding
              successes in online learning are being showcased and certainly live
              up to the flexible delivery catch cry of &#8220;just-in-time,
              just-enough, just-for-me, where-I-am&#8221;. They provide short
              response times, customisation and small chunks of learning to meet
              specific
          needs. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> However,
            well out of the spotlight is a whole library of online products gathering
            dust on virtual shelves. They haven&#8217;t worked so well
              and may deserve another catch cry: &#8220;just-wait-a-while, just-too-much,
              just-one size, where-am-I?&#8221; More often than not, these products
              focus on content provision, are pre-structured and designed for self-paced
              independent learning. While they may be the result of early efforts,
              uncomplimentary descriptors like &#8220;shovelware&#8221;, &#8220;pour
              and snore&#8221;, &#8220;spray and pray&#8221; and &#8220;electronic
              books&#8221; challenge us to explore alternative instructional
              design and facilitation models.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While
            these products will always have a place, the lesson is that content
            is not enough. Solitary learning through a pre-structured
                program doesn&#8217;t
                suit all types of learning needs, contexts and preferences. To
                provide a better balance between content and process, a diverse
                range of strategies
                aimed to make content more meaningful to learners, are fast being
                added to the toolboxes of instructional designers, teachers and
                facilitators
                working in online environments.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In
              an attempt to shift focus from content to the process of learning,
              my
                colleague Dr Sivasailam &#8220;Thiagi&#8221; Thiagarajan and
                I have designed, field-tested and evaluated over 20 email game
                templates with over 1,500
                players worldwide (Jasinski &amp; Thiagarajan, 2000a, Jasinski &amp; Thiagarajan,

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
            design and facilitation of email games is based on our belief that
            adult learners learn most effectively through
                  people-to-people
                  collaboration
                and construction of knowledge.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Email
            games are templates (or frames) for facilitating dialogue about different
            problems and issues and
              for encouraging the construction
                  and sharing of
                  new knowledge, understanding, perspectives and insights. The
                  core of
                  most email game templates contains real-world problems and
            issues that are salient
                  to the players. An email game engages participants in interactive
                  discussion of these problems and issues. Participants bring
            a variety of diverse
                  experiences and previous knowledge to the task. The facilitator
                  selects and implements
                  appropriate structures for different rounds of the game to
            encourage collaborative problem solving. </font></p>

            email game templates are designed to facilitate different types of

              facts, concepts, principles
                    and procedures)
                    and different outcomes (application, analysis, synthesis,

      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our
              work with email games has been accelerated by our practice of open
                platform design, where we provide a growing community of colleagues
              with access to our templates to use, improve, update, customise
            and return.
                We have found the distributed process of open platform design
            to be powerful in rapidly improving design and facilitation processes
              and confirming
                the usability of the games in a range of contexts. Through this
            iterative
                and dynamic process, what has also emerged is the concept and
        practice of <em>improvisation</em> as an instructional design framework.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Improvisation
              is an eclectic mix of ad-hockery and know-how. This
                  technique mixes together a fresh way of doing things with lessons
                previously learned.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Improvisation
            involves reworking precomposed material and designs in relation to
            unanticipated ideas conceived,
              shaped and transformed
                    under
                  the special
                  conditions of performance, thereby adding unique features to
                  every creation. (Berliner, 1994 p.241)</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
            concept of improvisation is perhaps more familiar in the contexts
            of theatre and jazz than
              in instructional design
                      and
                    online learning.
                    Yet
                    the fluid, fast, irregular, spontaneous and unpredictable
            online world is undoubtedly an expressive medium and lends itself
                      to the creative,
                    responsive, nimble and spontaneous approaches associated
            with
                    improvisation. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We
            have found improvisation to be an excellent strategy to enable a
            fast transition from the conceptual to the operational.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While
            improvisation is not a wild child that runs amok, it does contain
            an element of
              spontaneity and &#8216;winging it&#8217;. Like improvisation
                        in jazz, instructional design using improvisation is
              a disciplined craft that works creatively within a planning framework,
              yet can take advantage
                        of the unexpected. In short:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Improvisation
            does not involve the complete discarding
                          of planning, but a change in how planning is done and
                          in how
                          the plan is
                          viewed (Isenberg,
                          1987, p. 92).</em> </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What
            improvisation allows is concurrency: an opportunity to design, act,
            learn, reflect and renew as parallel
                            and complementary
                            undertakings
                            rather
                            than as linear and competing activities (Weick &amp; Westley,
                            1996).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Improvisation
            as an instructional design concept does not lock into the order and
            stability of the
                              predictable
                              associated
                              with the Instructional
                              Systems Design (ISD) model. Instead, improvisation
                              exploits and works with
                              contradictions and paradox: stable and unstable,
                              structured and flexible, predictable and spontaneous,
                              planned
                              and random, content
                              and process.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As
            an instructional design framework, it aims to continually re-invent
            new ways to respond in order
                                to achieve the
                                right blend for specific
                                learning needs. Improvisation creates more vibrant,
                                adaptive, innovative and flexible
                                designs that match - and indeed exploit - the
            technology to give a wider and more appealing range of learning
                                options. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
            our design process, we often refer to Weick&#8217;s metaphor of design
                                as improvisational theatre (Weick in Huber &amp; Glick,
                                1991, p. 347). Using this metaphor, Weick provides
                                the following assumptions that offer
                                practical guiding principles for the design process:</font></p>

            (1998) offers a particularly useful insight that is both conceptually
            and practically relevant
              to the context of improvisation as an instruction
                design framework: improvisation can be a developmental process

              parts of
                  the original without changing it drastically) variation (new

                        have been deliberately
                        designed to facilitate this first step, for while the
            content can be changed, the process stays the same. First timers
                        can simply plug in
                        their own content
                        and with some skills in facilitation, can feel confident

                principles. The master performers who take centre stage in an email
              game are the community of learners, not the teacher who becomes more
              of an
                orchestrator of the process. While the process underpinning the design
                of e-game templates is prefigured, generating and processing of the
              content is not. These need to be configured by the learners who work

                  roles to play,
                  the game is a collaborative effort. Weick (1998) uses the term &#8220;equivalence&#8221; to

                Based on improvisation, design jamming is a dynamic and iterative

                to remove
                the teacher from the

                learner through a learning-from-computer model of self-paced
                individualised instruction
          (Reeves, 2000). </font></p>

            jamming reclaims the teacher-learner, learner-learner relationship.
            Like any jam session email games
                  are temporal events,
                  which for a specified
                  time facilitate a creative flow of interaction between a group
                  of people who come together for the purpose of sharing an experience.
                  That experience
                  is to collaboratively problem solve, role play, brainstorm
            or confront controversial issues.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
            difference between traditional instructional design and design jamming
            can be likened to the difference
              between a jazz
                    quartet
                    in an intimate
              cabaret setting and a symphony orchestra in an auditorium:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>&#8230; the
            (jazz) musicians absorb the mood of the audience into their creative
                      process. During a more traditional performance, the symphony
            defines the mood for the audience (Crossan et al, 1996, p. 29).</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like
              a musical jam session, design jamming follows a recipe rather
                than a blueprint.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Weick
            (1993) differentiates between the two:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Architects
            may treat blueprints as givens, but people who improvise treat them
            as emergents. The
              givens for people who
                improvise are the recipes
                            and routines by which they generate actions that
            could become any one of several different blueprints. (p.350)</em></font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Design,
              viewed from the perspective of improvisation is not an easy option.
            </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Improvisation
            is more emergent, more continuous, more difficult to control, more
            tied to the content
                                of action
                                and more
                                affected by what
                                people pay
                                attention to than the designs implied by architecture
                                and more akin to an ISD approach. Even though
            improvisation may involve
                                more uncertainty,
                                it does thereby not become any less effective.
                Emergent, continuous designing
                                is sensitive to small changes in local conditions,
                                which means the design is continuously updated
                as people and
                          conditions change (p.350).</em> </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though
            improvisation is far removed from the more rigid structure of ISD,
            it is nevertheless,
                                  a high
                                  order
                                  skill. Improvisation
                                  does not
                                  abandon tradition, but extends and shapes it.
                                  Both Thiagi and I have significant
                                  experience in the use of the ISD model and
            know it from many dimensions: as instructional designers,
                                  project managers, teachers, professional
                                  developers
                                  and learners. This foundation is what allows
                                  us to &#8216;wing it&#8217; and
                                  play with the rules not by the rules. This
                            is the essence of design jamming.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
            other words, the freedom to jam relies on
                                    the discipline of previous mastery of foundation
                                    knowledge
                                    and skills
                                    and significant
                                    experience
                                    in the domains in which it is applied. (Crossan &amp; Sainty,
                                    1997) However, this is not the &#8216;hard
                                    mastery&#8217; of the clarity and control of
                                    the scientist or engineer&#8211;or the traditional
                                    instructional designer - but rather more akin
                                    to &#8216;soft mastery&#8217;&#8230;<em>which
                                    is more like the give and take of a negotiator,

              can be no better way to sum up the essence of our experiences with
              instructional design improvisation with email games, than
                to end with another
                    complex game simply played. The following description by
            Kanter (1989 ) and quoted in Crossan et al (1996. p.21) captures
            what
              improvisation means
            in a complex world:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>To
            some companies, the context in which they are now entered seems increasingly
            less like baseball or other
              traditional
                      games and more
                      like the croquet
                      game in Alice in wonderland &#8211; a game that compels
                      the player to deal with constant change. In that fictional
                      game,
                      nothing remains stable for
                      very long, because everything is alive and changing around
                      the player &#8211; an
                      all-too-real condition for many managers. The mallet Alice
                      uses is a flamingo, which tends to lift its head and face
                      in another direction

                      just as Alice
                      tries to hit the ball. The ball, in turn, is a hedgehog,
                      another creature with a mind of its own. Instead of lying
                      there waiting for Alice to hit
                      it, the hedgehog unrolls, gets up, moves to another part
                      of the court, and sits down again. The wickets are card
                      soldiers, ordered around by
                      the Queen of Hearts, who changes the structure of the game
                      seemingly at whim
                      by barking out an order to the wickets to reposition themselves
              around the court.</em> </font></p>

                        with the
                        rules, not by
                        the rules &#8211; or
