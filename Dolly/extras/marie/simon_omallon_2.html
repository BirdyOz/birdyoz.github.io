        a right-handed normal person as opposed to my natural leaning to being
        left-handed. Left-handedness, it seems would lead to my being an unacceptable
        social misfit. Early Australian schooling systems, (pre 1980&#8217;s)
        have left many people with a poor experience in education. At the age
        of 10
        I realised that school would not equip me for my life needs and so I
        proceeded to watch, witness, and log the social conditioning and interactions
        of
        my peers, myself, and others for reflection at a later date. My passion

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Quite
              simply, the ability to reflect on previous experience, that of
            my early schooling, and the serious consequences those experiences
            have on
              my life make it clear for me how those learning situations did
        not work or could have been modified to become positive. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
            my teaching practice each new subject is piloted and feedback is

            a full commitment
                to it. Reflection-in-action is an organic method useful for growing
          new learning opportunities.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
            same experiences apply to the online learning world. You must ask
            yourself, how can you design
              a learning experience (in
                  a new platform)
                  if you don&#8217;t
                  have the experience of using that platform as a student? Whereas
                  the consequences for the student having a bad time at school
                  will impact
                  on their life skills
                  and opportunities, the consequences of a poor online learning
                  experience affect the facilitator and the institution and not
                  so much the student.
                  How? The student logs off and seeks another learning environment,
                  the institution loses the student, but the student no longer
            loses the opportunity.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
            key to online learning opportunities and environments is to keep
            them relevant and engaging. Engaging,
                    a small concept
                    that will have
                    a large
                    impact. If the student finds the situation troublesome, irrelevant
                    or pedestrian they will pack up and go elsewhere. It is acceptable
                    for the learning to
              be challenging and even difficult as long as it is enriching.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> My
              colleagues will reveal an immense knowledge base for the designing
              of
                online learning models using a variety of devices. My most passionate
                experience occurred using online roleplays and so I would like
            to share this with you. Hopefully I have outlined why I feel it is
            essential
              that
                you participate in an online learning experience before you implement
        one for your students.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
            online roleplay experience is a half-story that the participants
            will unfold in real time as they interact with
              each other and their
                  environment. &#8216;Fashion
                House&#8217; is a simulated fashion industry scenario containing
                all the aspects of the fashion world that the students need in
                order to experience
                some of the set backs and victories that will occur for them
                in the real fashion world. This roleplay is designed to promote
                communications
                skills
                in a way that is completely relevant to the students&#8217; world.
                The participants get to experiment with social behaviour in a
                safe environment
          without the lasting consequences of the real world.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For
            the designer the building of the scenario must take into account
            all the possible
                  distortions and tangents that the participants
                  are
                  likely
                  (and unlikely) to take during the course of the model. One
            can expect and anticipate, but the playing will always reveal things
                  you could
                  not have
                  thought of. This is how the designer accumulates new skills
            and
                  ideas to resolve better models next time around. The designer
                  relies on his/her
                  bank of intuitions to create scenarios with the highest diversity
                  potential. That is, the designer must foresee where and how
          things will take place. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Let
            us then look at intuition for a moment. Consider that your intuition
            is a feeling of when a thing is right
              or not right.
                    Think harder and
                    you can recall your intuition as being broader that right
            or not right, it
                    also reveals ways and processes to do things. Intuitions
            do a lot more than that but we don&#8217;t need to get too deep
                    here. The key being that intuition reveals responses to stimuli
          from an informed memory.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Intuition
            is actually 3 types of intuitions, these being Pre-Operational, Operational,
            and Post-Operational
              intuitions.
                      If you speculate
                      your pathway of doing an activity before you begin the
            activity you are
                      using your pre-operational
                      intuition. Whilst you do the activity and you wish to change
                      direction you will use your operational intuition. When
            you are considering a
                      model of an existing activity with the view to determine
                      if there is a better
                      way for it to work (you are diagnosing its performance
            capabilities) you will recall your past-experience knowledge-bank
            and dissect
                      the new activity
          with your post-operational intuition.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Without
            any doubt intuitions are linked to action programs in the brain.
            The reason
              they work so quickly and imply
                        a feeling of correctness
                        is that you have been growing these action programs since
                        being a baby. Intuitions
                        accumulate throughout your life. This is why intuitions
                        are perhaps
                        the best tools for designing and moderating online learning
                        because they reflect
                        real-life experience. Intuitions reflect relevance, not
                        necessarily the academically/theoretically correct thing
          to do.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having
            said that it should be understood that if a person designs hats for
            winter climates they are most intuitive
                          about winter
                          hats, this
                          does not necessarily mean they are intuitive about
            designing learning experiences
                          for online education. The content expert in a subject
                          area will always be the most intuitive person on that
                          subject.

          To summarise it should be clear that the more you learn
                          about education and learning design, the more expertise
                          and experience
                          you bring to
                          creating new learning opportunities. If you participate
                          as a learner in these new
                          opportunities the more you bring a refined, reflective
                          and effective mind to creating the next generation
          of learning environments.</font></p>
