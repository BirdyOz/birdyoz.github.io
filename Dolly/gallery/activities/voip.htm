      <h1>VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)</h1>
      <p class="note"> Voice over Internet Protocol, also called VoIP (pronounced voyp) is the routing of voice conversations over the internet or through any other IP-based network. VoiP applications are telephone services that allows users to voice and text chat, share files, share hyperlinks, and conference call as well as see each other on video through a webcam.</p>

      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include VoIP?<br />
        </h2>
        <p>The biggest advantage of using VoIP is cost  savings. VoIP services are much cheaper than traditional landline telephone  services, and in some cases are even free when used between users of a specific  network. Another major strength of VoIP is its portability &ndash; since it uses the  worldwide network of the internet, users are not tied to any one physical  location for a variety of services. As long as you have a computer, a broadband  connection and, in some cases, a telephone adapter, you can make calls using  your VoIP account. VOIP is useful for shy students who in an online class, find it  more comfortable to participate than in a face-to-face class because they're  not communicating in front of a room full of people.</p>
        <h3>Features        </h3>
        <p>There are basically three ways of using VoIP - one is to have a PC  on both communicating sides; another is to have a Phone on one side and a PC on  the other and the third is to have two phones that use a VoIp connection.</p>
        <p>VoIP services range in complexity and cost. </p>
        <p>Users can sign with a service provider, similar to an internet  service provider (ISP) for their VoIP service for per call fee at a lower cost than  traditional telecommunications carriers offer for phone services. </p>
        <p>VoIP  services are often characterised by: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The ability to be able to make PC-to-PC  phone calls (which are often low cost) to any other computer anywhere in the  world (that has VoIP service installed as well, of course). </li>
          <li>The ability to be  able to make a PC-to-phone connection which is usually less in cost than  a &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; long distance call. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Web and mobile phone based VoiP applications are also popular  given their easy set up and use. These applications, characterised by the most  popular &ndash; Skype &ndash; enable free Skype to Skype calls and low cost Skype to phone  calls and SMS. <a href="http://www.skype.com/">Skype</a> is typically enables  users to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Call  other Skype users or landline or mobile phones</li>
          <li>See  which invited Skype contacts are currently online</li>
          <li>Share  web page addresses via Chat</li>
          <li>Text  chat</li>
          <li>Share  Files</li>
          <li>Conference  Calls (limited in size with free version)</li>
          <li>Send  SMS messages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Moreover,  VoIP services often include many  of the features we&rsquo;ve come to expect as standard with our traditional and  mobile phone service. These features include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>call forwarding</li>
          <li>call waiting</li>
          <li>voicemail</li>
          <li>caller ID, and</li>
          <li>three-way calling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Examples  of VoIp applications teachers can use include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Skype.com</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://www.skype.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external"><strong>http://www.skype.com </strong></a><br />
            Skype is free internet telephony. Skype is for calling other people on their  computers or phones. Download Skype and start calling for free all over the  world. </li>
          <li><strong>ineen.com  &mdash; <a href="http://www.ineen.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.ineen.com </a></strong><br />
                            Communicate  using Voice, Video and Instant Messaging. </li>
        </ul>

    <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating VoIP </h2>
        <p>VOIP has many educational possibilities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conduct one-to-one interactive meetings  with learners around the country and/or the world</li>
          <li>Conduct online audio  conferences with learner groups</li>
          <li>Support learners  one-to-one in between face to face sessions</li>
          <li>Meeting up with a  world wide group of learners who use Skype to collaborate and build learning  partnerships.</li>
          <li>Offer or participate  in distance education with learners able to work collaboratively on group  projects </li>
        </ul>
        Establishing  an online &ldquo;presence&rdquo; for learners to enable them to contact their trainer/other  learners while on placement or at work; they will know when members of their  learning network are online and are available for a chat or Skype call
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>            Develop the purpose  and framework for using VoIp with your learners</li>
          <li>            Support learners to  use VOIP in hands on sessions where you demonstrate downloading and installing  software.</li>
          <li>            Develop simple hand  outs to enable users to find their network, adjust their audio settings, set up  their microphone.</li>
          <li>Participate in a  demonstration session face to face where all learners chat, text, exchange a  file and use a web cam.</li>
          <li>Prepare learners for  using Skype remotely by encouraging them to set up and test all software and  hardware well ahead of any scheduled sessions using VoIP.</li>
          <li>Conduct an online  audio conferences providing alternative means of support for learners who have  difficultly logging on remotely (e.g. SMS, email, telephone)</li>
          <li>Organise for  learners to expand their use of VoiP to work collaboratively on group  projects. </li>
          <li>Hold debriefing sessions in the  face-to-face setting to clarify learner concerns and to collect feedback to  enhance the use of voice with your learners. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>It is also important in the design  process to consider the learner's ability to access the audio resources you  produce:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Many computer classrooms are not equipped  with speakers, so you may need to provide headphone sets.</li>
          <li>Learners who have either a hearing  impairment may be disadvantaged and require the same information provided to  them via a different means.</li>
          <li>For many users, VOIP can result in  trainers and learners talking over each other, waiting for the other to speak  when the other doesn&rsquo;t realize it. Develop protocols between users to overcome  this especially when internet lag makes natural conversational interchange  difficult.</li>
          <li>Prepare for  the number of learners who may need help with headsets, microphones, sound  cards, bandwidth, processing capacity, voice installations, and simply turning  the volume up. </li>
        </ol>
        You may record the voice component of sessions  you conduct using VoIp with free open source software such as Audacity. See the <strong>Podcast </strong>strategy for support on setting up and using Audacity for  recording and exporting sound.
      <h3>Assessment      </h3>
        <p>Participation  in online audio conferences can form the basis of an assessment task. If you  are intending to use contributions to such conferences you should clearly  outline to the learners how you will be assessing their online contributions.</p>
        A  good practise model for using voice based activities in teaching and learning  can be found here (<a href="http://www.flexiblelearning.net.au/flx/webdav/site/flxsite/shared/New%20Practices/Different_Voices_Different_Spaces_Report.pdf" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.flexiblelearning.net.au/flx/webdav/site/flxsite/shared/New%20Practices/Different_Voices_Different_Spaces_Report.pdf</a>)
      <h3>Generic skills</h3>
        <p>The use of VOIP provides opportunities  for the development of a number of generic skills. These may include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>working in groups and teams </strong>(defining  the roles in the team, crisis management, giving feedback to other team  members). </li>
          <li>Virtual <strong>problem solving</strong> and offering solutions to issues posed in the  discussion (developing creative and innovative solutions, applying a range of  strategies to solve problems) </li>
          <li><strong>communication  skills</strong> (using appropriate language for the audience, persuading  effectively, sharing information, asking for clarification, agreeing and  disagreeing) </li>
          <li>effective  use of a <strong>range of technologies</strong> for collaborative work, problem solving and  communication. </li>
      </ul>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>A  VOIP application usually requires an installation of a program &ndash; rather than a  flash or java download &ndash; onto the users computer. There  is a large range of VoIP services including Skype. Generally the technical  skills required to moderate an audio conference are at the low end and are a  good way into online learning for teachers. </p>
        <h3>Skills        </h3>
        <p>You will need skills in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>supporting  learners to set and install software</li>
          <li>using audio  hardware (microphones, headsets and speakers)</li>
          <li>moderating and  facilitating the discussion activities </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Moderating or facilitating a voice  discussion in an online environment involves a variety of roles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>welcoming to  the session initially</li>
          <li>ensuring all  learners are able to participate in the session with a headset and can speak  and be heard by all members</li>
          <li>establishing  and negotiating the rules of participation in the discussion <br />
            (value what others say, don't interrupt, turn taking etc)</li>
          <li>clearly outline  the purpose of the session</li>
          <li>rephrase what  students have said to ensure their point is clearly stated, if necessary</li>
          <li>provide links  from one aspect of the discussion to the other</li>
          <li>draw together  the disparate threads of the discussion to form a conclusion where the  discussion has been wide ranging. </li>
          <li>provide links to any recordings you make of the  session to your learners</li>
        </ul>
