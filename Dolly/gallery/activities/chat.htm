    <div id="why">
      <h2>Why include chat?</h2>
      <p>You might use online chats in a learning sequence for many reasons. Some options include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have scheduled, structured chat sessions which address specific  topics</li>
        <li>have regular chat sessions for problem solving, asking the teacher or trainer for help</li>
        <li>allow learners to arrange chat sessions for       dealing with teamwork issues and collaboration on assessment tasks and       projects</li>
        <li>invite a guest speaker  to join the chat room and have learners        prepare by reading an article by the guest) </li>
        <li>encourage learners to use chat for socialisation and the development of a learning community.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>participants are all online at the same time - real time (often called synchronous communication) </li>
        <li>can create the sense of a  virtual classrooms</li>
        <li>allows immediate feedback and problem solving </li>
        <li>allows interaction between tutors and learners and learners and learners </li>
        <li>some chat spaces allow for anonymity</li>
        <li>can become chaotic and unstructured which threatens some learners</li>
        <li>most systems allow for the chat to be recorded and a transcript can then be placed on the web site for participants and others to read later. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Chat sessions can involve a variety of methods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Text   chat<br />
      </strong>In a text based chat session participants  log on to their computers at the same time and join in a discussion  over the internet by typing in their comments in text. Participants can follow the discussion on screen as it unfolds. Contributions are typically very short, often only a few  words and seldom more than a sentence or two. Most learning management systems (LMSs) have a text based chat facility. These chat tools gives users the option to  contribute privately, one-to-one, as well as to the whole group. Trainers can  paste in previously prepared material to save time if needed.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="instant_messaging.htm">Instant messaging (IM)</a></strong> is a form of online communication that  allows real-time (or close to real-time) interaction through personal computers  or mobile computing devices. Users can exchange messages privately, similar to  e-mail, or join group conversations. While typed text remains the primary  convention for IM, the technology has allows users to send images, audio and  video files, and other attachments to their contacts. Instant messaging can  also be undertaken on mobile phones through SMS messages. </li>
        <li><strong>Voice and audio  chat</strong><br />
        Voice chat is  synchronous online communication   using a  variety of technologies including <a href="virtual_classroom.htm">virtual classrooms</a><em> </em>and <a href="voip.htm">Voice over Internet  Protocol</a>. These tools a  allow the facilitator and  participants to meet &quot;live&quot; online from their computers using a microphone or microphone headset for two-way voice communication, as well as  text   chat.<br />
        Virtual classrooms provide a rich variety of presentation options to show and discuss PowerPoints, websites, documents and graphics. (Many tools also now provide the option of  live two-way video  using low-cost webcams.)<br />
        Voice over Internet Protocol,  also called VoIP (pronounced <em>voyp</em>) is the routing of voice conversations over  the internet or through any other IP-based network. VoiP applications  are telephone services that allows users to  voice and text chat, share files, share hyperlinks, and conference call as well  as see each other on video through a web cam.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual  reality  chat</strong><br />
        <strong><a href="virtual_worlds.htm">Virtual worlds</a> </strong>are online  environments where multiple users can interact together or with characters or  interactive environments. In these immersive 3D environments   users have a great deal of freedom in choosing  where they go and who the   interact with. Users participate in the world through an &quot;avatar&quot;  or online persona, controlled with mouse movements and their keyboard. An avatar allows a user to choose how much  of their real self they wish to portray in the virtual world, potentially  allowing them to act as completely different people.</li>
        <li><strong>Video and  audio  chat<br />
        </strong><a href="../content/video.htm">Video and audio based</a><em> </em>(also  known as videoconferencing, video chat, webcam chat and web conferencing) provides  the most realistic form of real-time communication, although the quality of signal  varies depending on the hardware and software used and the connection speed.  Some VoiP systems enable webcam sharing, for example Skype. Most virtual  classroom services enable users to communicate using voice, text and increasingly  video through web cams or streaming video. </li>

      <h2>Integrating chat </h2>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Set up and name the chat rooms within your       online learning platform or service. </li>
           <li>Decide on the purpose of your chat session. <br />
             Chat sessions can be used for providing       socialising activities between learners and can act as icebreakers for new       groups. <br />
  Chat can be used to supplement and add value to discussion forum       activities, email interactions, group work, for clarifying and discussing       assessment tasks and for undertaking collaborative and problem solving       tasks between learners.<br />
           </li>
           <li>Inform learners of the time and purpose of the       chat. </li>
           <li>Send learners support information and       instructions to assist them in using the chat tool. <br />
               Items, readings, discussion starters and a chat       session agenda can be posted to the learners through email or discussion       forum a day or two before the chat session giving learners time to think       about the issues.<br />
           </li>
           <li>Send learners information on how to behave in       chat. </li>
           <li>Remind learners prior to each chat via email,       phone or SMS. </li>
           <li>Conduct the chat (draw together threads,       prompt participants, time keep). </li>
           <li>Save the transcript or archive of the chat and       place on the learning management system for review by learners.</li>
           <li>Follow up by email or phone with learners who       did not contribute during the chat, had problems entering the chat or       seemed overwhelmed by the discussion or the technology.<strong> </strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Abbreviated signals that can be used  for chat</strong></p>

      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>Although it is possible to assess participation in chat sessions,  there are some issues that need to be carefully considered before you adopt  this option. The most common complaints are that some learners will have real  problems with chat due to the speed if typing is required, and others have problems with the  multiple layers  of interaction. This could seriously disadvantage some learners. </p>
      <p>The ability to record voice  chat provides evidence  opportunities for learners requiring feedback on a completed task, describing  process, outlining a position or demonstrating grammar and vocational grammar  (for example, see the <a href="http://netspot.com.au/gtcasestudy/gippstage_06.htm">Medical Terminology</a> sample design on this site) </p>
      <h3>Generic skills </h3>
      <p>The use of chat sessions provides opportunities for the development of a number of the generic skills such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>communicating ideas and information </li>
        <li>working in teams</li>
        <li>problem solving</li>
        <li>using technology. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <p>Some organisations feel that chat can be a distraction to real learning and have blocked the use of chat behind their firewall. If you want to use it for an educational purpose you may need to speak to your system administrator to have such restrictions removed. </p>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>Most chat platforms are relatively simple to use for both the teacher or trainer and the learner. Basic internet skills and reasonable typing speed is an advantage — careful preparation can help here. If you have poor typing skills, pre-prepare some comments and prompts. These can then be copied and pasted at the appropriate time. </p>
      <p>Audio and VOIP based chat platforms and virtual classrooms will  require you to set up software and enable headsets (these contain a microphone  and speakers to enable users to speak and hear in sessions) to work on  computers including those of the learner. You can expect to have to support  learners to install software and configure their sound card settings prior to  participation in voice chat sessions.</p>
