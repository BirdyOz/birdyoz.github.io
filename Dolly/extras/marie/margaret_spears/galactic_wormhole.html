                        a read. It says:<br>

          be in the past and one end in the future.</em> <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Galactic wormholes? Time Travel?</strong> YOU HAVE NO CLUE how
                        you reached this page and you are completely perplexed.
                        You
                        decide to go
                        down the street
                        for a cup of coffee and a newspaper. You go outside and
                        WOW! You&#8217;re
                        dazzled by the bright sunlight as you step outside. When your eyes adapt,
                        you see that a new fangled machine has replaced the newspaper stand. Strange.
                        The machine has what looks like a video screen with a single large button
                        that says &quot;<strong>News</strong>&quot;. You press the button. <br>
          <br>
          A headline appears: <br>
