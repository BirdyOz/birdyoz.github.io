<h1>What is Online Assessment? </h1>

<p>&quot;What is Online Assessment?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Surely it's more than just multiple
choice questions?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could use it for group based assessments....roleplays, scenarios and collaborative assessment tasks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Communication and problem solving tasks could help me assess deep learning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could build a repetoire of tools.....quizzes, portfolios and tests.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This would increase flexibility and offer variety to different learning styles.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could give access to remote learners.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I could blend this with my classroom delivery&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So....where do I start?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;(I wonder what this site has to offer)&quot;</p>
