        <h2>Why include online journals?</h2>
        <p>Online learning journals collect experiences and reflections on the learning process on a regular basis. They are particularly useful for learners who are engaged in work placements or clinical experience. </p>
        <p>Trainers can support  learners to use a journal:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As a diary, to record their thoughts about their work and training
            <ul>
              <li>How would you describe your learning progress?</li>
              <li>What happened?</li>
              <li>Who was involved?</li>
              <li>What did you feel?</li>
              <li>Any thoughts on further progress?<br />
                </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>As a tool to help learners plan and reflect in a structured way&nbsp;
            <ul>
              <li>What helped you most to achieve this weeks learning  goals </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Many learners may be existing members of  social networking sites such as MySpace and FaceBook. However encouraging  learners to have separate a separate spaces for their journal is a great way to  teach learners about the different voices that they can have can use, the  different writing styles and the different communities they can maintain  through the internet. Many learners will not want to cross over their social  networking activities into your learning tasks.</p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>are often  based on personal reflections and feelings</li>
          <li>may be a conversation between the learner and the teacher or between learners and their peers </li>
          <li>may include responses to some sort of stimulus, content presentation, reading task etc</li>
          <li>can be used to ask learners to detail their thinking processes behind a particular problem they are solving or a project they are constructing</li>
          <li>can document the creative process during a design project </li>
          <li>demonstrate a learner's growing self awareness of their own learning </li>
          <li>teachers will often   keep their own journal as a model for learners. </li>
        </ul>

    <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating online journals </h2>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Decide on how to use a journal  in your online program.</li>
          <li>Decide on the technology platform learners will use to develop their journals. (see  the Technical notes below and <a href="blogs.htm">Blogs</a>,  <a href="wikis.htm">Wikis</a>, <a href="discussions.htm">Discussions</a> and <a href="portfolio.htm">E-portfolios</a>). </li>
          <li>Prepare instructions for your learners on how to develop and manage their online journals.</li>
          <li>Provide some models to your learners on how they may structure their reflections.</li>
          <li>Clarify the number and scope of entries and the degree to which the journal will be viewed by others.</li>
          <li> Offer suggestions, constructive remarks, questions, and encouragement on a regular basis.</li>
          <li>Provide instructions on how the electronic journal will be submitted (emailed to the teacher, placed on a website or blog, uploaded to a Learning Management System).</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>Using journals as an assessment task is fraught with difficulties. Learners are less likely to express themselves freely if they feel that their reflections and observations are going to be used in an assessment situation. However it is possible to use the journals or selected parts of the journal for assessment purposes provided that the learners are given clear guidance on the criteria which will be used to assess their contributions. Learners can be given an assessment rubric which clearly outlines expectations and how they will be assessed. As each journal is likely to be unique this is sometimes difficult to frame but is critical in ensuring a fair and valid assessment process. </p>
        <p>The Thinking Gear website at <a href="http://www.thinkinggear.com/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.thinkinggear.com/</a>provides tools to  develop a rubric electronically.</p>
      <h3>Generic skills </h3>
        <p>Working on a journal is likely to engage learners in reflection about their own learning which may assist them in developing generic skills. </p>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>There are several software  programs which learners could use to keep electronic journals. These include:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>using a Word processing program such as Word       or Word Perfect and either emailing or uploading the document at stated       times </li>
          <li>using the note-taking function in Learning       Management Systems such Moodle, Janisons and Blackboard which can be       compiled and saved as a text file </li>
          <li>developing a <a href="blogs.htm">blog</a> to record their experiences </li>
          <li>contributing to a group <strong>wik</strong>i to share       experiences with co learners</li>
          <li>maintaining a journal within a personal <strong>e       portfolio</strong></li>
          <li>setting up individual, private topics in a <a href="discussions.htm">discussion</a> forum which are only available to the teacher and the individual learner. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>You need skills in motivating learners, encouraging them in their writing and in providing constructive feedback. </p>
