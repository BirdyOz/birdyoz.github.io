Match the body sytem with it's primary function {
    Supplies your body with oxygen and rids your body of carbon dioxide. = Respiratory System
    Ingests food and water and breaks it down into usable nutrients. Excretes solid waste products. = Digestive System
    Moves materials between body systems, including oxygenated blood, nutrients, hormones, and waste products. = Cardiovascular
    Cleans dissolved waste products from the blood and excretes them. = Renal System
    Secretes hormones and other chemical signals that allow body systems to act cooperatively. = Endocrine System
    Controls all other systems.  Allows perception, emotion, thought, and rapid response to the environment. = Nervous System
    Provides structure and protection to internal organs. Allows the body to move on command. = Musculoskeletal system
    Covers and protects the body and regulates its exchange with the outside world. Transports excess heat to the environment. = Integumentary System
    Fights infection. = Lymphatic System
    The sex organs that allow for the production of offspring. = Reproductive System
}

Match the organ or tissue with the body system that it belongs to. {
    Lungs = Respiratory System
    Stomach = Digestive System
    Heart = Cardiovascular System
    Kidney = Renal System
    Pancreas = Endocrine System
    Brain = Nervous System
    Bicep = Musculoskeletal system
    Skin = Integumentary System
    Spleen = Lymphatic System
    Uterus = Reproductive System
}

}

Which three (3) statements are true of the MUSCULOSKELETAL system? {
    = Provides protection to internal organs
    = Allows for movement and motor skills
    = Includes both voluntary and involuntary muscles
    Controls perception, emotion and thought
    Filters and excretes waste fluids and electrolytes
}

The ENDOCRINE system: {
    = sends hormones throughout the body to trigger change and growth
    is responsible for maintaining fluid balance and pH
    exchanges heat with the outside world, to perform thermal regulation
}

Identify four (4) organs that are part of the DIGESTIVE system? {
    = Oesophagus
    = Mouth
    = Stomach
    = Intestines
    Kidneys
    Lungs
    Spleen
}

The role of the REPRODUCTIVE system is to: {
    = Create offspring through sexual repriduction
    Control perception, emotion and thought
    Trigger puberty through hormonal chynage
}

Which three (3) statements are true of the INTEGUMENTARY system? {
    = Creates a barrier with the outside world
    = Protects against injury, infection and fluid loss
    = Exchanges heat with the environment
    Filters the blood remove waste products
    Exchanges waste Carbon Dioxide for fresh Oxygen
}

The primary role of the LYMPHATIC system is to: {
    = Fight off infection
    supply oxygenated blood to body tissues
    allow for movement and motion
    provide structural protection to internal organs
}

Identify three (3) organs or tissues that are part of the NERVOUS system? {
    = Brain
    = Spinal column
    = Nerves and neurons
    Veins
    Kidney
    Spleen
}

The human body has ONLY five senses - vision, hearing, taste, touch and smell. {F}

The immune system {
    = fights off infection, such as bacteria and viruses
    causes illness and disease
    controls homestasis and maintains fluid balance
}

Identify four (4) factors for good health {
    = Healthy eating
    = Physical activity
    = Good and regular sleep
    = Maintaining effective hygiene and cleanliness
    Excessive alcohol consumption
    Avoiding exercise
    Adopting each new dietary fad that is promoted to you
}

Homeostasis is the: {
    = body sytems working togther to maintain a steady balance of temperature, water and pH
    medical desctription for remaining seted for prolonged periods of time
    mechanism that repairs damaged body tissues
}

Which three (3) body systems work together to balance fluid, electrolyte and pH balance: {
    = The respiratory system, by excreting CO2 that would otherwise turn to carbonic acid
    = The urinary system, by filtering the blood and expelling excess fluid and electrolytes
    = The digestive system, by consuming and repleneshing lost fluids and electrolytes
    The endocrine system, by sending hormones that trigger thirst and replenish lost fluids.
    The musculoskeletal system, by triggering stomach cramps that cause you to become hungry
}

Identify four (4) examples of the ellimination of waste products {
    = faeces, via the digestive system
    = urine, via the urinary system
