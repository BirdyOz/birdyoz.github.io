	</div>
      <div id="why">
      <h2>Why include problem-based learning?</h2>
      <p>Problem-based learning is based  on typical scenarios that learners would encounter, working in real life  situations. The process of finding the solutions to the problems is more  important than the solutions themselves. Often the activities require learners  to work in groups thereby developing valuable communication and team work  skills. Problem-based learning is a crucial learning  strategy that provides a learner centred approach.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Problems are presented which  are similar to those in real life contexts.</li>
        <li> The problems can be ill-structured - they are not neat and clearly defined in much the same way as they are in real life.</li>
        <li> Learners  are presented with a problem and they begin by organizing any previous knowledge on the subject, posing any additional questions, and identifying areas they need more information. </li>
        <li>Learners  devise a plan for gathering more information, then undertake the necessary research. </li>
        <li>Learners collaborate to  share and summarize their new knowledge. Online communication tools  are important in the problem solving process and the structure of the problem solving activities will often require learners to engage with each other using a number of communication tools. </li>
        <li>There is no one 'correct'  solution to the problem.</li>
        <li>As new information is gathered the problem may be redifined.</li>
        <li>Learners  solve the problems - teachers are coaches and facilitators.</li>
        <li>Authentic resources are provided to the learners to enable then to solve the problems. In an online envirnment this may include  multimedia, video, web links, access to visiting experts online etc. </li>
    </ul>      <a href="problem_based.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a> </div>
      <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating problem-based learning </h2>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>decide on an authentic problem which will       engage learners. </li>
           <li>map the competencies and content against the       problem. </li>
           <li>decide on how much of the content needs to be       explicitly delivered and what can be 'uncovered' by the learners during       the process. </li>
           <li>provide or develop a set of resources that       will assist learners in solving the problem. </li>
           <li>prepare learner support resources. This can       take the form of instructions, flowcharts, seeding questions or providing       examples of how these problem situations can be approached. </li>
           <li>Prepare an evaluation framework to work       through with your learners </li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>Problem-based learning lends itself to holistic assessment which examines the level of integration of interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and behaviours. Various assessment tasks can be used such as :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reflective <a href="journals.htm">journal</a></li>
        <li>self and peer assessment </li>
        <li>presentations/demonstrations of problem solving process and the solution </li>
        <li><a href="roleplay.htm">roleplay </a></li>
        <li><a href="presentations.htm">presentation </a>of videotape  or multimedia website.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Generic skills</h3>
      <p> Problem-based learning activities are designed to develop life skills and attributes at the same time as subject specific knowledge and skills. Some of the generic skills and attributes developed and assessed by PBL are as follows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>problem solving </li>
        <li>critical thinking</li>
        <li>initiative and enterprise </li>
        <li>communication </li>
        <li>planning and organising information </li>
        <li>lifelong learning.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <p>The development of problem-based learning  can require a range of technical approaches. Some of these will be relatively simple such as the placing the problems, approaches and resources on a website. Alternatively a more complex environment can be set up within an online learning platform which includes selective release of content, collaboration tools, multimedia demonstrations, mind mapping tools etc. </p>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>Teachers and trainers will need to step back from more didactic approaches and adopt a more learner-centred approach. Effective teachers will need to develop skills in guiding learners and their discussions. Questioning skills will centre on guiding learners to find solutions for themselves.</p>
      <p>Skills Trainers will  find useful include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clarifying the discussion</li>
        <li>Suggesting avenues of investigation for learners</li>
        <li>Putting the problem into a context that connects with prior learning  and experience</li>
        <li>Prioritising and clarifying issues that arise from the problem</li>
        <li>Stepping in to mediate group dynamics should these cloud the  learning objectives </li>
    </ul>
