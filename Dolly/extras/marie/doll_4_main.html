    <td><p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roni
          Linser and Albert Ip based in Melbourne Australia are inspired minds!
          They are the developers of the <a href="doll_4_main.html#" onMouseDown="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.fablusi.com','','')">Fablusi</a>  web-based
        role-play generator. We chose the Fablusi software as our first role-play
        environment to explore and Roni and Albert facilitated two workshops
        with us on designing and moderating role-play and acted as our mentors.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> They
          were also available as troubleshooters and technical advisers and
        they were much in demand! Luckily they were patient and generous with
        their time.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roni
          has been designing and moderating simulations within the Department
          of Political Science at the University of Melbourne
            for several years.
          In fact, that&#8217;s how Roni and Albert got together.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They
          now have a new company which specializes in political science role-play
          simulations.
            They use Fablusi of course! </font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At
          that time, for the Political Science role-plays, Roni provided a face-to-face
          induction as well as a face-to-face debrief and most students
        were on campus during the course of the role-play. We were exploring
        role-play as part of flexible and off campus delivery and soon discovered
      this was rather ambitious.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> While
          we are now exploring other role-play options, Fablusi got us started
          and it was Roni and Albert who with patience and endless support, helped
        us over major hurdles.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It
          was this experience that really instilled in us the value of working
          in teams. We shone in different ways. Some
            of us were good designers,
            others developed expertise in moderation while a third group came
          to grips with the technology. While a rare few could handle all three
            roles, we mostly relied on each other to focus on different aspects
            of getting
          a role-play up and running.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As
          we moved to the moderating stage we soon realized the critical role
          of debriefing. As Dr Sivasailam &#8220;Thiagi&#8221; Thiagarajan
            drummed into us &#8211; &#8220;<strong>The role-play is an excuse
            for the debrief</strong>&#8221;.
              Luckily for us, Thiagi was visiting Australia so we booked him in
            for a much appreciated workshop on &#8220;<strong>Debriefing Experiential
            Learning</strong>&#8221;.</font></p></td>
