    <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include mobile technologies?</h2>
        <p>m-learning makes the most of being on location,  providing immediate access, being connected, and acknowledges learning that  occurs beyond (and in conjunction with)formal learning settings, in places such  as the workplace, home, and outdoors.</p>
        <p>Central  to m-learning is the principle that it is the learner who is mobile rather than  the device used to deliver m learning.</p>
        <p>The  integration of mobile technologies into training has made learning more  accessible and portable. Mobile technologies make it possible for a learner to  have access to a computer and subsequently learning material and activities; at  any time and in any place. </p>
        Free  from the need to be at a computer lab or station to students can work on PDAs  at their desks, at home, at their workplace. Learners can take their PDAs on  field trips to collect, store and analyse data on site.
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>Mobile devices can include:    </p>
<ul>
  <li>mobile phones</li>
  <li>personal digital assistants (PDAs)</li>
  <li>personal digital media players (eg iPods, MP3 players)</li>
  <li>portable digital media  players</li>
  <li>portable digital  multimedia players</li>
  <li>portable gaming consoles</li>
  <li>Ultra-mobile Personal  Computers (light and small portable computers&nbsp;  that run Windows Operating Software as well as standard packages such as  Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Access) </li>
  <li>tablet PCs (like  laptop computers  except they come with a special pen to select, drag, and open files as well as enter handwritten notes).</li>
  <li>smart phones.</li>
</ul>
Mobile technologies can:
<ul>
  <li>provide anytime, anywhere access to content (depending on  the  mobile device) </li>
  <li>provide just-in-time  training or review of content</li>
  <li>enhance  learner-centred approaches</li>
  <li>facilitate  collaboration through synchonous and asynchronous communication.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mobile technologies can be used to deliver a range of formats for different learning strageties:</p>
<ul>
  <li>audio resources  (podcasts, sound files)</li>
  <li>video and  photographic/graphic resources</li>
  <li>communication (SMS  and MMS messaging)</li>
  <li>web content</li>
  <li>portable documents  (e books, word, excel, pdf etc)</li>
  <li>activities (games,  quizzes)</li>
  <li>interactive content  (navigable pages of topic information)</li>
  <li>cross&ndash;platform  activities and content (reuseable learning objects creating using SCORM also useable on Learner  Management and other course delivery systems)</li>
  <li>Bluetooth(system for mobile devices to connect and share  information, files and applications) </li>
  <li>Wi-Fi/WLAN (Wide Area Local Area Network) — learning activities where secure access to a campus based network of  information is required. </li>
  <li>Learning  in proximity (using Global Positioning System or GPS-enabled devices to deliver  content and learning activities triggered by a device or object at a specific location).</li>
  </ul>

      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating mobile technologies </h2>
        <p>Mobile technologies can be  integrated into training deliveries to make learning more accessible and  portable. An  m-learning approach should be deployed only to enhance the training strategy or  authentic context for delivery so that learners are provided with opportunities  to work from location or work.</p>
        <p>Deploying m-learning materials can  support equal access to learning by providing materials in a range of formats.  For example, a learner who is unable to access a mobile learning resource using  a mobile phone, media player or PDA should still be able to access a version of  the learning activity using a web browser or via downloadable or print based  resources.</p>
        <p>An m-learning approach should  respond to and address the diversity of the learner group, learning needs and  styles.</p>
        <p>M-learning should be deployed to provide situated,  relevant and flexible learning activities that enhance contextual learning and  communication and learning opportunities between and amongst learners and  trainers. </p>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Select the content to be presented and  break it into appropriate chunks.</li>
          <li>Storyboard the structure of the content  presentation.</li>
          <li>Build the content activity.</li>
          <li>Test and evaluate the content to ensure  that it performs correctly in all situations.</li>
          <li>Pilot the learning content and activity  with a select group of learners to evaluate the performance of your strategy  across a range of devices and learning styles.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Consider  the type of device you think will work to enhance your training delivery in  your content area. Cost is an important consideration. A particular device may  have the functionality required for your planned m-learning activities but it  may be too costly for the learner group that you are working with. The cost of  the device (initial investment) and using the device (ongoing investment)  should be taken into consideration when developing learning activities to be  carried out using a mobile device.</p>
        <h3>Assessment        </h3>
        <p>Opportunities  to use mobile technologies for assessment include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>learners to record their own  presentations or demonstrations.</li>
          <li>learners to record their own workplace  data on site</li>
          <li>learners undertake Occupational Health and Safety inductions  via mobile content</li>
          <li>learners record use of tools and  processes via audio and video and publish to an LMS or blog</li>
          <li>learners participate in mobile delivered  role plays that require responses to various work place scenarios</li>
          <li>learners  to complete orientation to workplace technology, tools and policy via GPS  workplace tour. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Generic skills        </h3>
        <p>The use of mobile technologies provides  opportunities for the development of a number of generic skills such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>communicating ideas and information</li>
          <li>working in teams</li>
          <li>problem solving</li>
          <li>using technology</li>
          <li>researching</li>
          <li>analysing  data. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        M-learning devices cover a range of hardware and delivery options. For more  detailed information on hardware and software applications and deploying a  variety of m-learning strategies visit the Austrtalian Flexible Learning Framework's <a href="http://e-standards.flexiblelearning.net.au/docs/m-standards-guide-v1-0.pdf">A  guide to working with m-learning standards.<br />
        </a><br />
Some mobile devices that deploy  web-based browsers often do not support scripting or plug-ins, which means that  the range of content that they support is limited. In many cases the user has  no choice of browser and upgrading it is not possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        Often the use of interactive and multimedia content  will require the end user to have plug-ins (Flash, Shockwave, audio and video)  installed on their PDA or MP3 player. While these plug-ins are becoming  standard ensure your learners can download any software that is required to  make the content presentation work properly. Ensure that any potential cost to  the learner in using your m learning strategy is clearly explained. Provide  alternative delivery options for situations where learners opt out of m  learning opportunities due to the cost of connectivity or where a trainee&rsquo;s  employer does not support cost.
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>good planning and organisational skills</li>
          <li>experience with mobile technologies or  access to mentor with same</li>

            Most general principals    and recommendations for e-learning content development found on the Framework's   E-standards for Training website are applicable to m-learning content also. However, m-learning has some unique challenges, with devices containing reduced screen    sizes, lacking in standard input devices (such as a mouse and keyboard) and    reduced computing power.<br />
