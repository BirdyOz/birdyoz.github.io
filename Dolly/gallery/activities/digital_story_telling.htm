      </div>
      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include digital  stories?</h2>
        <p>Teachers and trainers have long recognised the value of video as a teaching and  learning tool. With the wide availability of digital cameras, video projectors, free software for editing and cheap storage media, production of short video products is now accessible for a range of non-specialist or amateur producers, including individual teachers, learners and community groups.</p>
        <h3>Digital story telling </h3>
        <p>&quot;Digital story telling&quot; (or DST) is the term that has come to be used for amateur digital video making which has these features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>it tells a personal story, usually a first-person narrative of a reflective or biographical nature</li>
          <li>it combines spoken voice with music to convey mood or emotion</li>
          <li>it uses still or moving images mostly recorded by the storyteller</li>
          <li>it is produced on low-cost or free tools which don't require advanced technical skills</li>
          <li>it is edited on a standard PC using free software</li>
          <li>it is usually produced for an event or specific audience, rather than as a continuing resource.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this sense, digital storytelling has been most used in vocational education and training (VET) in Australia as a project activity for learners (students, or teachers themselves in professional development settings) rather than as a source of re-usable learning materials for courses.</p>
        <p>Use digital storytelling as learner activity for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>projects enabling the integration of a  range of literacies — digital, oral and written in English language or adult  literacy program </li>
          <li>projects to re-engage youth </li>
          <li>developing learner&rsquo;s  communications skills by learning to ask questions, express opinions, construct  narratives and write for an audience</li>
          <li>developing basic  computer multimedia skills by using  variety of multimedia to tell a story. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Digital stories</h3>
        <p>The same digital technologies can and are  being  used to develop learning and presentation materials which don't have the other characteristics of digital storytelling. They are simply a low-cost form of digital video production made possible by the  technologies now available on every PC, and the expanding options for distributing the digital products (learning management systems, blogs, mp3 players). Video clips now present a new option for interested individual teachers or trainers who don't have (or don't want) the services of a multi-media unit. They are especially popular in trade subjects to demonstrate processes. </p>
        <p>In a vocational training and education (VET) context digital stories are particularly good for  capturing workplace  experiences. Consider the use of teacher-developed digital stories for:</p>
        <ul><li>producing engaging instructional material where a  personal story is significant</li>
          <li>using personal experiences to  contextualise workplace experiences and new skills</li>
          <li>documenting work processes for motivated learners — that is, where the presentation quality (and instructional design) is not a critical issue.</li>
        </ul>

      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating digital stories  </h2>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <p>Consider the purpose of the video and the needs of the target  audience. Often a 'home-made' video, with a strong pedagogical focus is a much  more effective teaching tool than something glossy that has been commercially  produced.</p>
        <p>The design steps for digital video usually include:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li><strong>storyboarding and       scripting</strong><br />
            a process of roughing out the subject matter of the       clip, often in sketch form (<a href="http://www.vetonline.swin.edu.au/digitalvideo/session1.htm" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">storyboarding techniques</a>) <br />
            Here is a <a href="http://www.jasonohler.com/pdfs/digitalStorytellingStoryBoard.doc" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">sample story board</a> that can be used.<br />
            Finding the right story requires brainstorming ideas that fit       the stories purpose and audience. Mind maps can help explore ideas,       organize details, and decide which ones will be used to tell the essence       of the story. </li>
          <li><strong>organising and managing files</strong><br />
            Managing       all the files - text, images, sound, music, and final product - is needed       to ensure everything is where it needs to be for your project. <br />
          This is particularly important once you begin editing later because most       video-editing software references (rather than actually embeds) the media       elements for your story. If the media elements are not kept together, the       project will need to be re-pointed to the original files. </li>
          <li><strong>script development</strong><br />
          Establishing the       narration (voice over) that provides the &quot;teacher's voice&quot;       or the dialogue between characters in the video. </li>
          <li><strong>digital video recording</strong><br />
          Using either a       digital video camera or a digital still camera capable of recording short       video sequences (<a href="http://www.vetonline.swin.edu.au/digitalvideo/session2.htm" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">recording techniques</a>) </li>
          <li><strong>editing</strong><br />
            Joining
          the video sequences together, using       digital video editing tools (<a href="http://www.vetonline.swin.edu.au/digitalvideo/session4.htm" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">editing techniques</a>) </li>
          <li><strong>presentation</strong><br />
          Determining the most appropriate way(s) to       deliver the video to your learners and to integrate it into your delivery       (<a href="http://www.vetonline.swin.edu.au/digitalvideo/session5.htm" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">delivery techniques</a>). </li>
          <li><strong>copyright</strong><br />
          Making sure that the       media selected from outside sources is being used legally and ethically. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is also important in the design process to consider the learner's  ability to access the video resources you produce:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Digital video files can become large and take       a very long time to download, particularly over a dialup connection. Learners       wishing to access these resources from home may prefer that they be       provided on CD to avoid downloads. </li>
          <li>Specialised software, (media players), may be       required to view the video. </li>
          <li>Many computer class rooms are not equipped       with speakers, so you may need to provide headphone sets. </li>
          <li>Learners who have either a visual or hearing       impairment may be disadvantaged and require the same information provided       to them via a different means. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Copyright issues are important  if you use images or music or video you find on the internet. The  media files you use in your story should be licensed or are shared with  permission to re-use; this is the only way you can safely then share your new  creation knowing it does not contain any copyrighted material. Finding media  assets via Google is not satisfactory. For each media file you find, document  the source by title and URL and find a person or organization to use to give  credit.</p>
        <p>Visit  this list of sites to find audio, images and video you can use on your digital  stories - <a href="http://cogdogroo.wikispaces.com/StoryMedia" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://cogdogroo.wikispaces.com/StoryMedia</a><br />
          You  can also purchase images, graphics and video cheaply from a variety of sites  that give you the right to distribute media files that contain the assets you  have purchased. </p>
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>One opportunity to use digital stories for assessment is for  the learners to record their own stories that  require learners to research a topic from a particular point of view.</p>
        <p>Be considerate of the technical component of digital video and digital  story telling production. It may be unreasonable to  expect learners to master the technical as well as scripting and storyboarding  skills as part of their delivery. A simple way of facilitating this  might be to provide learners with access to a digital still camera that records  video sequences. Excellent digital stories can be  created in this way, using Windows Movie Maker. The learners could then  submit this file without having to develop any production skills. </p>

        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>Digital video production has a reputation for being difficult to learn  and time consuming to produce. This need not be the case.<br />
The advent of affordable digital cameras (digital video cameras and  digital still cameras capable of recording short video clips), coupled with  increasingly easy to use video editing software, has seen video production  become much more accessible. Many home users are now using digital video  technologies to edit and produce their own home movies.</p>
        <p>Cameras can record video on mini DV tapes (requiring a  capture or &ldquo;recording&rdquo; to be transferred to your computer via a connecting USB  or firewire connection) or straight onto onboard hard drives (enabling quick  transfer to your computer through a USB or firewire connection) </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Start small. Begin by producing very short       targetted sequences. </li>
          <li>Initially, consider recording single sequences       using a digital still camera capable of recording short video clips. The       files produced can then be distributed without the need to learn any video       editing techniques. </li>
          <li>Choose a video editing tool that matches your       level of experience. There are many very sophisticated tools available,       such as Adobe Premier, but they are often very difficult to learn to use. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/default.mspx" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">Windows Movie Maker</a> (PC) or <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">i-Movie</a> (Mac) are a good starting       point for beginners. </li>
          <li>Similar educational results can often be       achieved by synchronising still images with audio. There are a number of       tools that facilitate this, including Microsoft Powerpoint and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">Microsoft Photo Story</a> . </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>good planning and organisational skills </li>
          <li>experience with digital cameras </li>
          <li>confidence to trial different software       packages. </li>
