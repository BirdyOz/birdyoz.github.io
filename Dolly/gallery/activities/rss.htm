      <h1>RSS (really simple syndication)</h1>
      <p class="note"> (Variously known as Rich Site Summary or Really Simple  Syndication) RSS is a family of web feed formats  used to publish frequently updated content such as blog entries, news headlines  or podcasts.<br />
    An RSS  document, which is called a &ldquo;feed&rdquo; or &ldquo;web feed&rdquo; contains either a summary of  content from an associated web site or the full text. RSS is used most commonly  to subscribe to blogs and podcasts.</p>

    <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include RSS?</h2>
        <p>RSS enables learners to subscribe  to web content of interest and control the flow of information that they  receive. RSS feeds can be accessed from a variety of web sites and tools and be  concentrated or &ldquo;aggregated&rdquo; into a central location through the use of &ldquo;feed&rdquo;  or &ldquo;news&rdquo; readers. </p>
        <p>By incorporating RSS &lsquo;feeds&rsquo; on  your teaching and learning resources, you can gather and publish linked  snippets of information relevant to your training topic area and distribute  this information to your learners quickly through the use of these &ldquo;news&rdquo; or  &ldquo;feed&rsquo; readers.</p>
        <p>Learners can develop their own  blogs, wikis, podcasts, and other web 2.0 and social networking sites as part of  the learning process that can be subscribed to by trainers, learners and web  users through the of RSS. Content developed in this way that is marked as <strong>RSS</strong> or <strong>XML</strong> are RSS feeds. Most Web 2.0 tools include an RSS feed on an account by  default. (An RSS or newsfeed is an XML text file that sends information about  news items to a newsreader application like the <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> or by some browsers including  Safari 2, Opera 8 or Internet Explorer&nbsp;7.) The RSS reader acts as an  aggregator, allowing users to view and scan multiple content streams in a  timely fashion.</p>
        <p>Among  a group of learners this information can be shared using their individual  account on a feed reader. Using RSS can encourage greater engagement with  self-publishing and feedback by all learners. </p>
        <h3>Features        </h3>
        <p>RSS  can:</p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>deliver current information from the internet       in our areas of expertise or interest. </li>
          <li>provide content for websites and blogs. </li>
          <li>bring additional traffic to a website or blog. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>RSS feeds  have some advantages compared to receiving frequently published content via  email:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When subscribing to  a feed, users do not disclose their email address, so users are not increasing  their exposure to threats associated with email: spam, viruses, phishing, and  identity theft.</li>
          <li>If users want to  stop receiving news, they do not have to send an &quot;unsubscribe&quot;  request; users can simply remove the feed from their aggregator.</li>
          <li>The feed items are  automatically &ldquo;sorted&rdquo; in the sense that each feed URL has its own sets of  entries (unlike an email box, where all mails are in one big pile and email  programs have to resort to complicated rules and pattern matching).</li>
          <li>Most feed readers  enable single items of interest from various feeds to be clipped and  characterised for ease of reuse</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Popular RSS readers that trainers  can use include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Bloglines - <a href="http://www.bloglines.com">www.bloglines.com</a> </li>
          <li>Google Reader - <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">www.google.com/reader</a> </li>
          <li>Feedbucket <a href="http://www.feedbucket.com">www.feedbucket.com</a> </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each RSS feed reader provides the same basic features:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Subscription to an RSS feed. Each RSS feed       reader has its own method for subscribing to feeds. </li>
        <li>Reads the RSS feed on a regular schedule to       see if there is anything new. </li>
        <li>Displays  all the new items.</li>
      </ul>
        <p><a href="rss.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a> </p>
    </div>
      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating RSS </h2>
        <p>RSS Feeds can be used for a variety of purposes  including sharing content and as an adjunct to the submission of assessment  material by providing links to information research during preparation.</p>
        <p>RSS are easily updated and new information can be  shared with learners if they are provided with support and demonstration using  RSS feeds in conjunction with news readers.</p>
        Start by setting up an RSS news aggregator.  There are a variety of aggregators available; including websites that act as  news aggregators and free software you can download onto your computer.
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ol>

          <li>Prepare instructions for your learners on  how to develop and manage their RSS feeds</li>
          <li>Decide on the RSS reader learners will  use to create and manage their RSS feeds</li>
          <li>Support learners to subscribe to the specified  RSS reader</li>
          <li>Commence with only one or two RSS feeds  so as to not overwhelm learners in information</li>
          <li>Demonstrate how to create an RSS feed for  a news search</li>
          <li>Demonstrate how to create an RSS feed for  a blog search</li>
          <li>Demonstrate how to create an RSS feed for  a news group search</li>
          <li>Demonstrate how to create an RSS feed for  a website search</li>
          <li>Offer suggestions, constructive remarks,  questions, and encouragement on a regular basis.</li>
        </ol>
        Show  how to collect clippings of useful information for later use from amongst the  feed items retrieved.
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>RSS feeds can provide a useful adjunct to  assessment tasks by providing evidence in information gathering, collaboraton  and research. RSS feeds can be used in conjunction with other web 2.0 tools:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Social bookmarking<br />
            Trainers and learners can create bookmarks of  internet sites, share them and syndicate these findings</li>
          <li> Blogs<br />
            Learners can keep their own blogs. Trainers can  subscribe to content updates.</li>
          <li> Photo  sharing<br />
            Learners  can use digital cameras to record process or assessment tasks. Using a  photo-sharing site such as Flickr (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.flickr.com</a>) these images can be  uploaded and then syndicated. As learners add new images, co learners and  trainers newsreaders will update the content.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Generic skills</h3>
        <p>Some of  the generic skills and attributes developed and assessed by the use of RSS  feeds are as follows: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>effective use of <strong>technology</strong></li>
          <li>planning and organising information</li>
          <li>sorting and assembling information from a  variety of sources</li>
          <li>evaluating and catergorising information</li>
          <li> lifelong  learning. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>RSS readers require no specific software  to be installed (other than a web browser). They are easy to use and update</li>
          <li>There are a number of different RSS  readers. Explore them to find one that suits your needs.</li>
          <li>Become familiar with the way your  particular reader works by using the help pages that accompany the site.</li>
          <li>Plan  to induct the learners into the basic steps for subscribing and managing RSS  feeds.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Skills        </h3>
        <p>Good instructional and organisational skills may be  required. Learners are likely to require a high level of support, particularly  during whilst setting up their RSS reader.</p>      <a href="rss.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a></div>
