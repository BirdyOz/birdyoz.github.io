	<div id="why">
      <h2>Why include digital video?</h2>
      <p>Teachers have long recognised the value of video as a teaching and  learning tool. Televisions and VCRs are commonplace in the classroom.  Increasingly, video is being presented to the learners using digital  technologies such as DVD, VCD, across a computer network, via the Web, iPods, Mobile Phones and Personal Digital Assistants.</p>
      <p>Videos are good for demonstrations and illustrating concepts, ideas and  examples. They can be supported by text, captions, diagrams, still images,  descriptions, interviews and interactions.</p>
      <p>You can use Video to support learners to think out and present workplace  processes and work flows using video.&nbsp;  When you create your our own videos as a group with learners as opposed  to viewing 'others films', it enhances interactions and personalizes within the  groups. Learners of varying age groups enjoy and sustain their enthusiasm for  learning with computers by first learning about using digital cameras, working  as a team and planning a short video using video footage or still images to  develop a story that would have impact in their community or work place.</p>
      <p>Videos can be used to highlight, freeze-frame or slow motion an event  can be of incredible benefit e.g. playing a musical instrument or performing a  work task or sequence.</p>
      <p>Videos place emphasis on the visual, hence clear subtitles; on-screen  labels or voice-overs can benefit the language learner - and ESL learners.</p>
      <p>Videos can be stored on-line allowing learners (especially those who are  slow learners) to re-view a topic several times. Videos can be shared in blogs,  wikis, Learner Management Systems and websites using embedding code from video  sharing websites.</p>
      <h3>Digital video</h3>
      <p>In a VET context digital video is particularly good for describing and  visualising processes, for example:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>laying a course of bricks </li>
        <li>sharpening a knife </li>
        <li>adjusting a hand-brake </li>
        <li>pruning a rosebush </li>
        <li>Erecting a roof truss. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Complex processes that would be very difficult to describe in written  text can be elegantly conveyed with a short video sequence.</p>
      <p><a href="video.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a> </p>
	</div>
    <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating digital video </h2>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <p>When using videos consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are so <strong>many  videos available online</strong>, on so many different topics that it is often more  effective use of your time to use &lsquo;others videos&rsquo; than create your own video</li>
        <li>Videos are <strong>highly  transferable </strong>i.e. you can embed them on web sites for your learners to  view, download and play on your computer, embed them in PowerPoint, download  and play on a mobile device (e.g. downloaded and played through a Video iPod  attached to a data projector or TV) </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Developing your own videos </h5>
      <p>Consider the purpose of the video and the needs of the target  audience. Often a 'home-made' video, with a strong pedagogical focus is a much  more effective teaching tool than something glossy that has been commercially  produced.<br />
        The design steps for digital video usually include:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>storyboarding - a process of roughing out the       subject matter of the clip, often in sketch form (<a href="http://www.vetonline.swin.edu.au/digitalvideo/session1.htm" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">storyboarding       techniques</a>) </li>
        <li>script development - to establish the       narration (voice over) that provides the &quot;teacher's voice&quot;       and/or dialogue between characters in the video </li>
        <li>digital video recording - using either a       digital video camera or a digital still camera capable of recording short       video sequences (<a href="http://www.vetonline.swin.edu.au/digitalvideo/session2.htm" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">recording techniques</a>) </li>
        <li>editing the video sequences together, using       digital video editing tools (<a href="http://www.vetonline.swin.edu.au/digitalvideo/session4.htm" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">editing techniques</a>) </li>
        <li>determining the most appropriate way(s) to       deliver the video to your learners and to integrate it into your delivery       (<a href="http://www.vetonline.swin.edu.au/digitalvideo/session5.htm" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">delivery techniques</a>). </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is also important in the design process to consider the learner's  ability to access the video resources you produce:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Digital video files can become large and take       a VERY long time to download, particularly over a dialup connection.       Learners wishing to access these resources from home may prefer that they       be provided on CD to avoid downloads. Consider       uploading to a video sharing site or using a compression tool such as <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro/">QuickTime Pro</a> to reduce the       video size to enable them to be played over the web.</li>
        <li>Specialised software, (media players), may be       required to view the video. </li>
        <li>Many computer classrooms are not equipped with       speakers, so you may need to provide headphone sets. </li>
        <li>Learners who have either a visual or hearing       impairment may be disadvantaged and require the same information provided       to them via a different means. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Take a look at the at &ldquo;How to do Task  Videos&rdquo; at <a href="http://aquaculturepda.podomatic.com/entry/2007-05-05T16_33_35-07_00" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://aquaculturepda.podomatic.com/entry/2007-05-05T16_33_35-07_00</a></p>
      <h3>Embedding videos in a webpage, blog, wiki, LMS webpage etc.</h3>
      <p>The  driving force for the rise of online video has been user-generated content  hosted free on sites like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://video.google.com.au/">Google Video</a>, <a href="http://www.jumpcut.com/">JumpCut</a>, <a href="http://revver.com/">and Revver</a>. Embedding an existing online video from  one of these sites into your blog, wiki, social networking site or Learner  Management System requires a few steps: (for this example we have searched for  video at YouTube)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Search for the video for your site by using the search tools. Review  the results and choose a video that fits your delivery context.</li>
        <li>Look on the video page for the embed code. If you just want the  link, copy the link and put it into your blog post or links page in an LMS like  you would any hyperlink. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>But...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you want to embed the video, select the embed code on the video  page (in this example for the video at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYJYCoY_lto" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYJYCoY_lto</a> - Timber Framing Program Winter 2007:<br />
          <table border="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%">
            <tr>
              <td><p align="center">
                  <textarea name="textarea" cols="55" rows="3">&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/DYJYCoY_lto&amp;rel=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;wmode&quot; value=&quot;transparent&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/DYJYCoY_lto&amp;rel=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; wmode=&quot;transparent&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;355&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</textarea>
              </p></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <ul>
            <li>Select the code and copy it ready to embed in your  site/blog/wiki/LMS etc. Make sure you have the complete code. </li>
            <li>Login to your blog/wiki or LMS. Write a post, describing what you  are about to play for video and any advance advice on what information you  would like the learners to find or watch out for.</li>
            <li>Click on the Edit HTML tab. This will change the text on your screen  to html, which allows you to paste the embed code from YouTube. </li>
            <li>Make sure there is at least one space before and after the embed  code. The embed code should be it&rsquo;s own paragraph. Save and you should see the  video embedded on the page.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Find out more about embedding  video into a wiki <a href="http://aquaculturepda.wikispaces.com/EmbedVideo">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Copyright issues are important  if you use images or music or video you find on the internet. The  media files you use in your story should be licensed or are shared with  permission to re-use; this is the only way you can safely then share your new  creation knowing it does not contain any copyrighted material. Finding media  assets via Google is not satisfactory. For each media file you find, document  the source by title and URL and find a person or organization to use to give  credit.</p>
      <p>You  can also purchase images, graphics and video cheaply from a variety of sites  that give you the right to distribute media files that contain the assets you  have purchased. </p>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>One opportunity to use digital video for assessment is for the  learners to record their own presentations or demonstrations. </p>
      <p>Be considerate of the technical component of digital video production.  It may be unreasonable to expect learners to master these skills as part of  their delivery. </p>
      <p>A simple way of facilitating this might be to provide learners with  access to a digital still camera that records video sequences. The learners  could then submit this file without having to develop any production skills. </p>
      <h3>Technical notes </h3>
      <p>Digital video production has a reputation for being difficult to learn  and time consuming to produce. This need not be the case.</p>
      <p>The advent of affordable digital cameras (digital video cameras and  digital still cameras capable of recording short video clips), coupled with  increasingly easy to use video editing software, has seen video production  become much more accessible. Many home users are now using digital video  technologies to edit and produce their own home movies.</p>
      <p>Cameras can record video on mini DV tapes (requiring a  capture or &ldquo;recording&rdquo; to be transferred to your computer via a connecting USB  or firewire connection) or straight onto onboard hard drives (enabling quick  transfer to your computer through a USB or firewire connection)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Start small. Begin by producing very short targetted sequences.</li>
        <li>Initially, consider recording single sequences using a digital still camera capable of recording short video clips. The files produced can then be distributed without the need to learn any video editing techniques.</li>
        <li>Choose a video editing tool that matches your level of experience. There are many very sophisticated tools available, such as Adobe Premier, but they are often very difficult to learn to use. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/default.mspx" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">Windows Movie Maker</a> (PC) or <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">i-Movie</a> (Mac) are a good starting point for beginners.</li>
        <li>Similar educational results can often be achieved by synchronising still images with audio. There are a number of tools that facilitate this, including Microsoft Powerpoint and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">Microsoft Photo Story</a> . </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Good planning and organisational skills </li>
        <li> Experience with digital cameras </li>
        <li>Confidence to trial different software packages . </li>
