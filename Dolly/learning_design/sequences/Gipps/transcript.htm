<h1>Using Basic Medical Terminology</h1>
<p class="note"><strong>Central Gippsland Institute of TAFE - Lynn Huguenin</strong></p>
<h2>About The Course
</h2>
<p>The course that we are talking about is using basic medical terminology, and that means that the students are learning about words that they are meeting in their workplace, or that they might meet if they are working in an office situation, such as a receptionist for a general practitioner or any other allied health organisation. They also might be working in a health insurance claims area.
  The course is online because a lot of these people are in isolated or interstate areas and they wouldn't be able to come into our educational institution to take this course. Many of them are working full time.
  We have been able to reach people all over Australia and all over Victoria in isolated communities who wouldn't have been able to access this sort of course otherwise.</p>
<h2>Building A Learning Community</h2>
<p>We try to run a collaborative course to enhance the course material and the learning experience for the students. Some of them also come in large groups from their own organisation and they find that they prompt each other to complete the material and to share their learning as a group. They can also share their learning online with other participants, so if they are coming in on their own, they are not necessarily isolated.
  The material that we had from TAFE Frontiers is good content material, but it doesn't necessarily engage the learners, and encourage them to participate in a learning community, so by adding the discussion forum and the email facility to the course, that allows them to form a community themselves, and for me to support them and for them to support each other in the pursuit of their learning.</p>
<h2>Using Audio</h2>
<p>The audio files are online. In our current group, we have four people who do not have access to sound from their computers, so we are in the process of creating a CD for them, so they will be able to access this material from a CD in a normal CD player, rather than via their computer.</p>
<h2>Learning Activities</h2>
<p>I send them an email about a timetable, to let them know exactly what they have got to do in each week, and also the phone conference dates.
  We have a phone conference in the first week as an ice breaker.
  Within the course, we have the welcome discussion forum. I start that off by posting my own welcome page where I introduce myself.
  We have some discussion topics and an open discussion board where they can chat amongst themselves. I give them a group story, which is a bit of fun.</p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>The assessment tasks vary.
  We have a listening task to listen to three reports that have been recorded and then type those reports out. That's probably one of the most challenging tasks.
  One of the assessment tasks I use is a quiz. The quiz that we use is automatically graded and then recorded online, and that is certainly the way that I mark that activity. I don't even look at it, other than to see what the score is.</p>
<h2>Using Email</h2>
<p>With all the other assessment activities, they submit the work to me via email, using a word attachment or an excel attachment, and so I access it that way and mark it in the conventional sense and then I send them an email back with feedback.
  Once the course is up and running I try to keep constant emails at least twice a week, probably more often in the first week to get them to realise yes it is happening, and now is the time to do it, and not to leave it to the last minute.</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>We have had a tremendous success rate with the course.
  We have had a 95% successful completion rate from our participants.
  We have run five basic medical terminology courses this year and four advanced medical terminology, and we have got two more booked in for later in the year for Western Australia.
  As the course draws to a close I provide a forum for them to give me feedback on how they have found the course and any improvements they might like to suggest, and also a forum for them to say goodbye to me and to each other.
