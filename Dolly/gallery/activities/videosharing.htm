      </div>
      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include the use of video sharing? </h2>
        <p>The  use of video files by trainers can provide a wide range of applications in the  training environment and augment existing content delivery strategies. Video files can be downloaded and played by  learners from their computer, on portable mp3 players and mobile phones.</p>
        <p>Video podcasts (sometimes shortened  to vidcasts or vidcasts) enable learners to engage with content in a familiar  format at times for which access to other online learning content is difficult  (for example, during lunch breaks, travelling to work, while undertaking  domestic duties). </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Video podcasting allows users to <em>subscribe </em>(generally free of charge) to a video podcast, and then as new video files  become available (episodes), they are <em>automatically downloaded </em>to their  computer. These podcasts can then be viewed either on a computer (without going  to the internet) and/or loaded onto some form of mobile media including mobile  phones, iPod, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) or MP3 players. The video  podcast can then be viewed anywhere and anytime.</p>
        <p>Video podcasting extends the use of video files by  enabling the learner to subscribe to learning content provided in video form  through the use of RSS feeds. Video files can be uploaded to free sites such as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> or <a href="http://video.google.com.au/">GoogleVideo</a> for ease of distribution to  users who can then either subscribe to the RSS feed or view directly from the  site from an embedded media player.</p>
        <p>These feeds can be subscribed  to either in an internet browsers (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox) or  podcatching software. RSS feeds can also be used to subscribe to blogs, wikis,  websites with a news delivery function and social bookmarking sites. Trainers  can selectively release podcasts and blog materials to learners by encouraging  learners to use RSS feeds.</p>
        <p>Video  without the RSS is called video streaming because the videos cannot be  subscribed to. These videos must either be manually downloaded or streamed live  over the internet. </p>
        <h3>Teaching and learning opportunities</h3>
        <p>Videos are good for demonstrations and illustrating concepts, ideas and  examples. They can be supported by text, captions, diagrams, still images,  descriptions, interviews and interactions.</p>
        <p>You can use Video to support learners to think out  and present workplace processes and work flows using video.&nbsp; When you create your our own videos as a  group with learners as opposed to viewing 'others films', it enhances  interactions and personalizes within the groups. Learners of varying age groups  enjoy and sustain their enthusiasm for learning with computers by first  learning about using digital cameras, working as a team and planning a short  video using video footage or still images to develop a story that would have  impact in their community or work place</p>
        <p>Videos can be used to highlight, freeze-frame or  slow motion an event can be of incredible benefit e.g. playing a musical  instrument or performing a work task or sequence.</p>
        <p>Videos place emphasis on the visual, hence clear  subtitles; on-screen labels or voice-overs can benefit the language learner -  and ESL learners</p>
        <p>Videos  can be stored on-line allowing learners (especially those who are slow  learners) to re-view a topic several times. Videos can be shared in blogs,  wikis, Learner Management Systems and websites using embedding code from video  sharing websites<br />
          Video  files and video podcasts can be used to provide learning content in training as  follows:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>to record face  to face sessions or specific summaries of sessions for absent learners and for  learners to review later</li>
          <li>to provide  extra material for self-paced learning</li>
          <li>to share video  recordings of guest speakers from remote locations</li>
          <li>to provide  interviews with subject experts or industry figures</li>
          <li>to support  learners with literacy and/or other learning difficulties</li>
          <li>multi-lingual  education</li>
          <li>to enhance  language learning in, for example ESOL (pronunciation guides), foreign language  lessons, or indigenous languages storytelling and oral culture</li>
          <li>as  instructional training material for trades</li>
          <li>as an  assessment tool through learner-created video files uploaded to a shared class  blog or wiki</li>
          <li>to provide  third party content on relevant subject areas </li>
          <li>as a support to walking  tours of workplaces for training induction or specific instruction.</li>
        </ol>

      </div>
      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating the use of video sharing </h2>
        <p>There are so <strong>many videos available online</strong>,  on so many different topics that it is often more effective use of your time to  use &lsquo;others videos&rsquo; than create your own video. Explore <a href="http://video.google.com.au/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Google  Video</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.videojug.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">VideoJug</a> for videos you can  use with your learners. <br />
Video  podcasts can be used for a variety of purposes including sharing content and an  alternative approach to the submission of assessment material.</p>
        <p>Videos can be shared with learners  by &ldquo;embedding&rdquo; the video into web page content or providing the link or by  posting the embedded video to a blog or wiki. They can be easily updated and  new video files can be shared with learners if used in conjunction with a blog that  has an RSS feed.</p>
        <p>For information on  creating your own videos with learners, visit the <a href="../content/video.htm">Digital video</a> strategy  from the Gallery. </p>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <p>Video Podcasts need to be prepared in accordance with your  training objectives.</p>
        <p><strong>Planning</strong></p>
        <p>While  you may not need a script, it is helpful to have an outline of what you're  going to say and do.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>3 to 5 minutes  maximum.</li>
          <li>Consider using  a variety of presenters</li>
          <li>Don&rsquo;t just  film a talking head, cut away to show a wider scene or environment.</li>
          <li>Plan  material/topic you are going to record (consider what would make an interesting  podcast)</li>
          <li>Consider  mixing up the video presentation through the use of narrative, question and  answer, interviews and guest speakers</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Production</strong></p>
        <p>A variety of video editing software is available. These  include <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/updates/moviemaker2.mspx">Windows  MovieMaker</a> (Windows only, free) and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">Apple iMovie</a> (MAC only, free with  a new MAC).</p>
        <p><strong>Publishing</strong></p>
        <p>Once you've created your first vidcast, you need to  prepare it for publishing and post it to the internet.<br />
          You can publish yourself either to a web host or learning  management system.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Save the file in WMV or MOV or MP4 (for iPod)  format.</li>
          <li>Upload the file to a web host</li>
          <li>Create  a link to the file in a blog post.</li>
          <li>Creating  a special podcast RSS feed either a) by hand, b) by using a third party service  (e.g. <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a>) or c) by using  blogging software that creates podcast feeds automatically (for example <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Podcasting">WordPress</a>)</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>You can also  publish to Web-based Podcast Service and Host</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Save the file in WMV or MOV or MP4 format.</li>
          <li>Select an online podcast service (for  example <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> or <a href="http://video.google.com.au/">GoogleVideo</a>)</li>
          <li>Upload the file and create a blog there</li>
          <li>Share the podcast through an RSS feed or  blog post</li>
          <li>Copy and paste the html code for your  podcast to embed it into a media player on any website </li>
        </ol>
        For more information  on creating RSS feeds, visit the <a href="rss.htm">RSS</a> strategy from this gallery.
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>One opportunity to use video sharing for  assessment is for the learners to record their own presentations or  demonstrations and upload them to video sharing websites such as YouTube and  Google Video.</p>
        <p>Be considerate of the technical component of  digital video production. It may be unreasonable to expect learners to master  these skills as part of their delivery. Demonstrate the process of uploading  and sharing Videos and the process of making these available through either  embedding the video in a blog or wiki with the code provided or encouraging  users to subscribe to this and other videos through the use of RSS feeds.</p>
        <p>A simple way of  facilitating this might be to provide learners with access to a digital still  camera that records video sequences. The learners could then submit this file  without having to develop any production skills.
        </p>
        <h3>Generic skills</h3>
        <p>Vidcasts  can be used to share a variety of information and learning materials with a  learning group. With support, podcasts can be used as an assessment tool given  direction on the form and content of the video file required. Learners will be  developing their written and oral communication skills and capacity to order  their thoughts for a viewing audience through the scripting and production of a  podcast. The use of technology is embedded in each stage of the video  production and sharing process.</p>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>If you  aim to use Vidcasts in assessment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep the required length of the podcast  submitted to between 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Be clear on the competencies, generic  skills, and performance criteria that need to be demonstrated.</li>
          <li>Provide clear guidance on the type of  content required in the Vidcast.</li>
          <li>Give tips on making the vidcast engaging  through using a variety of voices, narrative, question and answers and  interviews.</li>
          <li>Consider opening a class-based account at  a podcast service so learners can easily upload and share their podcasts  together. This will enable learners and the trainer to provide direct feedback.</li>
          <li>Remind learners that podcasts on podcast  services are publicly accessible although some sites enable private shared  areas. Learners do not need logins to view the material so discretion should be  exercised when publishing personal materials (for example digital stories,  workplace case studies, etc).</li>
          <li>Encourage the group to subscribe to the  group podcast through an RSS feed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Digital  video production has a reputation for being difficult to learn and time  consuming to produce. This need not be the case. The advent of affordable  digital cameras (digital video cameras and digital still cameras capable of  recording short video clips), coupled with increasingly easy to use video  editing software, has seen video production become much more accessible. Many  home users are now using digital video technologies to edit and produce their  own home movies.</p>
        <p>Cameras can record video on mini DV  tapes (requiring a capture or &ldquo;recording&rdquo; to be transferred to your computer  via a connecting USB or firewire connection) or straight onto onboard hard  drives (enabling quick transfer to your computer through a USB or firewire  connection)</p>
        <p>Start  small. Begin by producing very short targetted sequences. <br />
          Initially, consider recording single sequences using a  digital still camera capable of recording short video clips. The files produced  can then be distributed without the need to learn any video editing techniques. </p>
        <p>Choose a  video editing tool that matches your level of experience. There are many very  sophisticated tools available, such as Adobe Premier, but they are often very  difficult to learn to use. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/moviemaker/default.mspx" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Windows Movie Maker</a> (PC)  or <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">i-Movie</a> (Mac) are a good starting point  for beginners. </p>
        <p>Similar  educational results can often be achieved by synchronising still images with  audio. There are a number of tools that facilitate this, including Microsoft  PowerPoint and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/photostory/default.mspx" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Microsoft Photo Story</a> .
