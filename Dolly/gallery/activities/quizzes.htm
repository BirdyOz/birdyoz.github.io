      <div id="why">
      <h2>Why include computer marked quizzes?</h2>
      <p>There are a number of reasons why you may choose to use computer marked quizzes in your delivery:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>pre-course diagnostic testing  to determine learners' prior knowledge </li>
        <li>          self-assessment for learners to check their progress through a topic </li>
        <li>          formative assessment which assists learning through feedback </li>
        <li>          summative assessment to test learners' mastery of the content. </li>
        <li>provide feedback on teaching strategies </li>
        <li>provide multiple opportunities for learners to       practice understanding</li>
        <li>identify areas of learner misunderstanding</li>
        <li>engage learners with content and maintain their interest       levels</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Some other benefits are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>potential time saving for teachers after the initial development time </li>
        <li> the ability to monitor the progress of learners  through more frequent assessments</li>
        <li>enhance  learning through the inclusion of graphics and multimedia</li>
        <li>the abilty to generate   diagnostic reports in Learning Management  Systems (LMS) such as WebCT and Blackboard</li>
        <li> automatic integration of results which can be  entered into administration systems</li>
        <li>  automatic feedback given to learners during and after a quiz.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>Computer marked quizzes can include a number of different question types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>multiple choice questions</strong> (MCQs) which allow the learner to choose from a list of possible answers. </li>
        <li>special types of multiple choice questions such as <strong>True/False</strong> and Yes/No questions. </li>
        <li><strong>multiple response questions</strong> (MRQs) which  involve the selection of more than one answer from a list.</li>
        <li><strong>text/numerica</strong>l questions which involve entering text or numbers. </li>

      <h2>Integrating computer marked quizzes </h2>
      <h3>Design steps for developing quizzes for Learning Management Systems</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>          Write questions either in a text document or directly into a software package  (eg Respondus)<br />
        The more subjective the answer to the question is, the more judgement needs to be used by the Learner in deciding if the answer to the question is correct - on-line quizzes marked by the computer will need to be objective.</li>
        <li>Develop feedback statements for the Learner for correct and incorrect answers. Providing Feedback on why an answer is wrong enables additional learning opportunities to enable the Learner to retake the question with an informed answer.</li>
        <li>Upload to questions into the database of a  Learning Management System </li>
        <li>Create quizzes by selecting individual  questions from the database</li>
        <li>Assign settings to quizzes
          <ul>
            <li>scores and weightings for questions </li>
            <li>number of  questions shown at any time</li>
            <li>time allowed for completion  of each question</li>
            <li>number of attempts allowed</li>
            <li>dates for release</li>
            <li>feedback options</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The following  suggestions for drafting quiz questions come from <a href="http://www.unisanet.unisa.edu.au/learningconnection/staff/practice/online-collaborate.asp">Online  collaborative learning - Issues in on-line delivery: Quizzes and discussion  groups</a> :<br />
        When writing <strong>Short Answer Questions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>avoid lengthy  questions, make them as simple and direct as possible</li>
        <li>make sure that there  is a definite correct answer</li>
        <li>be precise</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When writing <strong>Multiple Choice Questions</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>present a simple  well-defined problem in the question </li>
            <li>ensure that the  alternative answers all relate to the question in some way </li>
            <li>include as much as  possible of the item in the question </li>
            <li>make the question as  brief as possible </li>
            <li>consider using  graphics to illustrate the question </li>
            <li>alternative answers  should all be grammatically consistent with the question </li>
            <li>avoid mutually  inclusive and mutually exclusive answers as much as possible </li>
            <li>vary the position of  the correct answer (use the randomise answers tool if available) </li>
        </ul>
          <p>When writing <strong>True/False Questions </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>keep statements brief </li>
            <li>avoid partly true and  partly false items </li>
            <li>avoid using two or  more ideas in a question </li>
            <li>avoid words like  &lsquo;all&rsquo;, &lsquo;always&rsquo; or &lsquo;never&rsquo; &ndash; this tends to give away the fact that this is the  wrong answer </li>
            <li>avoid broad general statement    </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Assessment</h3>
    <p>Computer marked quizzes can be used for both summative and formative assessment. They would generally be used as part of a range of assessment strategies.
      A Trainer or another learner can mark quizzes within a computer system  or Learner Management System on-line, or completed and lodged electronically  but marked.        </p>

    <h3>Technical notes</h3>
    <p>Learning Management Systems usually have a tool for  constructing  quizzes and question banks. They also have various strategies for the delivery of these quizzes to learners.There are other software products which have the ability to integrate with Learner Management Systems to simplify the development of questions.        </p>

    <h3>Skills</h3>

    <p>There are a number of skills which you will need to have to deliver quizzes online:        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>the ability to write valid questions</li>
          <li>the ability to use quiz creation software</li>
          <li>the ability to load and manage the quizzes and databases in an online environment</li>
          <li>the ability to monitor quiz completion.</li>
