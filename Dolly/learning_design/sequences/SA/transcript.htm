<h1>Cert II in IT (Computer Operations)</h1>
<p class="note"><strong>TAFE South Australia - Kathy Schultz</strong></p>
<h2>The Course</h2>
<p>Leprechaun Computer Store started as an AFRIT by the electronics and information technology faculty to help provide a way for students to access typical workplace guidelines, and policies in order to complete their Certificate II competencies.
  This initiative was picked up by the computing faculty for their Certificate II  students, and typically it's introduced to them early on in their course.</p>
<h2>The Learners</h2>
<p>This assessment activity is for the <em>Certificate II  in Information Technology</em> students.
  These learners are a diverse group, both in terms of their background in computing and as well as in their age groups.
  The reason we have chosen this approach is because many learners don't have access to workplace, in which to be assessed for their competencies, and the specific competencies in the <em>Certificate II  in Information Technology</em> really lend themselves to practical workplace tasks.</p>
<h2>The Solution (Part 1)</h2>
<p>They begin by watching a powerpoint presentation, which gives them information about different aspects of the simulated workplace assessments.
  At the end of the powerpoint presentation, they are welcomed onboard as the newest PC technician at Leprechaun Computer Store. Then they have an opportunity to do some staff orientation, and answer some questions about what they have seen in the powerpoint.</p>
<h2>The Solution (Part 2)</h2>
<p>The next step is for them to visit the technology precinct, which has several virtual businesses.
  They click on the Leprechaun Computer Store shopfront, and are asked to log on before entering the business.</p>
<h2>The Solution (Part 3)</h2>
<p>Once inside, they can move their mouse around the room and click on various parts of the room, which will then link them to documents, or to other rooms.
  If they click on the computer workstation, it leads them to a variety of documents, including standard operating procedures, work constructions, policy and guidelines and job specifications.</p>
<h2>The Solution (Part 4)</h2>
<p>When the students are ready to have their competencies assessed, they sign up for a timeslot, and are welcomed to Leprechaun Computer Store for their very first job. Typically, their first job requires that they go out to one of three clients and perform preventative maintenance on their computers.
  Before going to the clients worksite, the student must look at the work request and determine the equipment required to successfully complete their tasks.
  The student is welcomed to the worksite by the manager.
  The manager has been instructed that they may answer questions about the worksite, but not help the student perform their tasks.
  I found that this type of assessment activity is most successful when the lecturer is just there in the background, as an observer. If necessary the lecturer can step in to offer support or clarification.
  The competency is determined in the end, by whether or not the learner is able to finish the tasks successfully within a reasonable time frame.
  The reason we have chosen this approach is because many learners don't have access to a workplace, in which to be assessed for their competencies, and the specific competencies in the <em>Certificate II  in Information Technology</em> really lend themselves to practical workplace tasks.</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>Students who have participated in this approach have enthusiastically embraced the roleplay in opportunity.
  Those students who had previous workplace experience have commented that it is very realistic.
  One student commented that it helped him to understand the importance of being able to access and use documentation.</p>
