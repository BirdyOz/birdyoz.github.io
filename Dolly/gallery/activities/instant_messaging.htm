      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include instant messaging?</h2>
        <p>Instant messaging can be used to provide feedback and  support to learners from any location. Users who are 'online' can be 'seen' and  a request for a chat initiated. Instant messaging tools are now embedded in a  variety of tools including blogs, wikis and virtual worlds providing an  additional layer of communication with learners.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Instant messaging provides a heightened &lsquo;social  presence&rsquo; for learners especially for those who are distant or remote. Learners  can keep in contact between virtual or face-to-face sessions. For many learners  they is no learning curve with using instant messaging as they will be existing  and active users . </p>
        <p>The  ability of instant messaging tools to be always 'on' and easy to use provides  increased collaborative opportunities in work groups and information sharing between and amongst  users. </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Instant  messaging is the ability to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>easily see whether a chosen friend or co-worker is  connected to the internet and, if they are, </li>
          <li>exchange text messages with them. Instant messaging  messages are delivered immediately. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Users can connect from anywhere &ndash;  home, office, learning centre and many services allow learners with mobile  phones to participate on the move. </p>
        <p>Like discussion  forums, instant messaging promotes a range of dialogue, including</p>
        <ul>
          <li>asking and answering  questions</li>
          <li>expressing  opinions or feelings </li>
          <li>showcasing  talents, links, or projects. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, unlike message boards that  archive knowledge, instant messages last only as long as the chat window within  the instant messaging 'client' stays open.</p>
        <p>Instant messaging tools enable users  to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>create a list of  contacts so users can see who also in online at the same time</li>
          <li>select a contact  and start a text or audio conversation with that person</li>
          <li>add in other  contacts to create a small conference</li>
          <li>continue to work on  other applications while the Instant Message tool sits on the taskbar to be  signed in or out</li>
          <li>send an instant  message</li>
          <li>send  files/photos/audio/video with your contact(s)</li>
          <li>display a profile  that lists as much of their personal details as they allow</li>
          <li>can set up a webcam  and have a video conversation</li>
          <li>open multiple  windows displays all messaging from other people within their contact group </li>
          <li>can use voice  over IP (VoIP)to make a voice call to another PC.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The most popular instant  messaging programs available on the internet include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ICQ </strong>- <u><a href="http://www.icq.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.icq.com/</a> </u> </li>
          <li><strong>MSN Messenger </strong>- <u><a href="http://messenger.msn.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://messenger.msn.com</a> </u> </li>
          <li><strong>Yahoo Messenger </strong>- <u><a href="http://au.messenger.yahoo.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://au.messenger.yahoo.com/</a> </u> </li>
          <li><strong>Skype </strong>- <u><a href="http://www.skype.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.skype.com/</a></u> </li>
          <li><strong>Twitter  &ndash;</strong> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.twitter.com</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Teaching  and learning opportunities</h3>
        <p>Some of the  potential benefits and opportunities of IM with your learners include: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>bringing real-world       experts into your learners environment (who wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise be able to visit due to distance) </li>
          <li>bringing greater levels       of interactivity and engagement into learning activities for learners that       extend beyond training room activities </li>
          <li>using real-world tools       learners will use outside the classroom walls and in real life</li>
          <li>enabling learners to  learn and practice effective digital collaboration techniques and virtual work  practises, especially collaboration and information sharing</li>
        </ul>

    <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating Instant messaging </h2>
        <h3>Design steps        </h3>
        <p>Instant  messaging systems rely on two pieces of software to work:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a central server  used to manage messages from  the different people using the system</li>
          <li>software (usually free) known as a &lsquo;client' which users   install to connect to the central server and access the tools needed  to send and receive messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Trainers may  need to support users to install their client software and establish their user  details initially.Trainers should  explore using instant messaging systems with colleagues, friends or families  before using with their learners to become orientated to the features and  drawbacks of each system. An informed decision can then be made on which  messaging tool will work best with their particular learners.</p>
        <p>Trainers will need to prepare themselves  for interacting with learners using their chosen instant messaging tool: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a  profile. Learn the system and make a profile that represents you in a realistic  way that your learners can relate to you as they know you in the training room.  Use your own profile and your own experiences to introduce conversations in a  face-to-face environment with your learners. Your posts will provide a model  for your learners but look to their use too for depictions of acceptable use as  you find your way.</li>
          <li>Do not go  looking for your learners online, but if they invite you to be Contacts,  accept. Write a kind comment back to them if appropriate and make certain to  respond to comments that you receive. </li>
          <li>The more present online&nbsp; you are, the more opportunity you have       to influence the norms of your learners. The goal in being present on       these sites is not to enforce rules, but to provide responsible models of       use and virtual communication through the learning activities you guide       your learners to complete through these tools.</li>
          <li>Be sensitive to the communication of the group and be prepared to       mediate where necessary. Be mindful of the grey area between learning and       social life of your learners(privacy and       intrusiveness issues)and the potential for miscommunication (due to lack       of verbal and visual cues). Be specific about your availability online and       aware of the informality of the medium. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Trainers will need to prepare with their learners  for  potentially  difficult situations and provide  some guidelines to learners on how to handle and resolve these. For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>instant messaging can sometimes  encourage negative behaviors, for example gossiping and cyber bullying </li>
          <li>users may receive pornographic  'spam' through theur instant messaging program or email associated with account </li>
          <li>users may receive computer viruses via file transfers  that are not scanned by anti-virus software.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Assessment        </h3>
        <p>Participation in instant messaging  can form the basis of an assessment task especially for activities built around  collaboration and teamwork. If you are intending to use contributions to  informal chats, file transfers and contacts for assessment purposes you should  clearly outline to the learners how you will be assessing their online  contributions.</p>
        <p>Many instant  messaging tools allow you to create a compiled list of an individual's  exchanges with contacts that can be used in assessment, particularly their  dialogue with you as the trainer. </p>
        <h3>Generic skills        </h3>
        <p>Instant messaging activities offer  extremely rich opportunities to foster generic skills. Activities using the  array of tools there may involve:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>working in pairs or <strong>teams</strong> in private text/audio       chats/conferences <br />
            (defining the roles in the team, crisis management, giving feedback to       other team members) </li>
          <li><strong>problem solving</strong> and offering       solutions to issues posed in the discussion (developing creative and       innovative solutions, applying a range of strategies to solve problems) </li>
          <li><strong>communication skills</strong> <br />
            (writing which is appropriate to the audience, persuading effectively,       sharing information, asking for clarification, agreeing and disagreeing) </li>
          <li>effective use of <strong>technology</strong>. <br />
            (through file sharing, sharing URLs, posting to blogs)</li>
          <li><strong>collaboration</strong> and <strong>information</strong> sharing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>Instant Messaging tools are very popular and can  present issues for Learning organisations due to the bandwidth they consume  particularly where file transfer and audio chat is undertaken. You may need to  check with your IT administrator to clarify whether firewalls block any of the  Instant Messaging tools and features. Generally the technical skills required  to participate in text chat, file transfer or working with contacts a are at  the low end and are a good way into online learning for teachers.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>You will need skills in:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>setting up the instant messaging tool (eg downloading and setting up       software, managing messages, navigating messages) </li>
      <li>moderating and participating in&nbsp;the discussion activities involving conferencing with learners </li>
      <li>mediation between learners in the event of disputes or 'flaming' </li>
      <li>archiving message and chat threads for the provision of evidence       for assessment tasks and learning activities.</li>
