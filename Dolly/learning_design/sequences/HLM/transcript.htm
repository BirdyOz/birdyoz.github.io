<h1> Cert I Hospitality (Kitchen Operations)</h1>
<p class="note"><strong>Holmesglen Institute of TAFE and Didasko - Ross Digby </strong></p>
<h2>Learners and the course
</h2>
<p>The learners using the Didasko package containing units from <em>Certificate II in Hospitality Operations</em>, are drawn from a range of government and catholic secondary colleges, and other independent schools in Melbourne's South Eastern region. These learners are all in either year ten or eleven and undertaking hospitality units drawn from a national training package, in order to archive competency in units one and two in VCE hospitality.</p>
<h2>About the course</h2>
<p>  The VET in the VCE hospitality program is widely offered in Victoria, and is delivered by TAFE's, private register training organisations, and schools who are auspiced by a TAFE, or other RTO, to do with some use in the VET in the VCE hospitality program or have RTO status within their own right.
  All units that make up the VET in the VCE hospitality program are drawn from the national training package. The training package units that are contained on the CD-ROM are all drawn from this national training package.</p>
<h2>Using Didasko resources</h2>
<p>Learners undertaking this program at Holmsglen TAFE, use the Didasko package in the classroom, computer room and kitchen as their core resource. Learners will spend approximately ten percent of their lesson time in the computer room using the Didasko learning package, reading notes, doing demonstrations and participating in a range of interactive activities designed to assist in understanding the processes and methodologies and the underpinning skills and knowledge for each unit.</p>
<h2>Working with young learners</h2>
<p>Due to the young average age of learners, between sixteen and seventeen years undertaking this program, they have very little knowledge or experience in the hospitality industry and as such, we needed to develop skills and knowledge from a low base, therefore, the variety of learning resources that are used need to enable learners to learn through a variety of methods, listening, reading, participating, provide working examples of hospitality situations which learners may not have encountered in the classroom, or in their normal activities outside of school. Allow learners easy access to learning resources at home, school or TAFE, or in the workplace, and to be able to test the learners knowledge or understanding in order that they are able to demonstrate their competency in a particular program.
  As learners only attend TAFE one day a week, the Didasko package enables learners to easily access learning resources at other times, either at home, school or other areas where they may have a computer and CD-ROM reader.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>Some of the challenges that had to be addressed in delivering a VET in the VCE in hospitality program were providing the learners with a cost effective resource, comparable in price to other print and media based resources in the market place.
  Secondly, ensuring that the ICT resource package was available to be used by learners who have a range of computer skills and learning styles, and ability to direct their own learning. Changing the manner in which the program was delivered to enable the Didasko package to be integrated into training sessions each week, and finally insuring that learners were able to direct their own learning as they could using the Didasko package.</p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p>The Didasko package provided a number of solutions in assisting us in delivering the VET in the VCE hospitality program.
  Firstly, the learners have access to both print based and multi media materials, learners are able to test and assess their underpinning skills and knowledge through  self assessments in the Didasko package, in classroom discussions and exercises and practical exercises in the unit kitchen classes, and finally learners are able to access materials at any time, be it at home, school or TAFE.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>We have been very pleased with the results that have been achieved through the use of the Didasko package for VET in the VCE hospitality.
  As a result of this, students have been able to review, prior to attending class what they are going to be doing. They are able to work at their own pace through their units. They can check their existing knowledge against the standards required through the use of self tests on the CD-ROM, and they are able to vary their learning materials, so they are not reading, or listening or participating all the time.
  It has also enabled us to provide consistency in delivering and assessment through providing all trainers with consistent resources, consistent lesson plan and consistent outcomes.
