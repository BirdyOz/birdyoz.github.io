	</div>
	<div id="why">
      <h2>Why include blogs?</h2>
      <p>A  Blog (short for web log) is often used as a personal journal that can be updated  frequently and is intended for general public consumption. Blogs generally  reflect the personality of the author.</p>
      <p>Blogs  can be easily maintained and updated through a standard web browser without the  need for additional technologies. They are often free of charge to establish.</p>
      <p>With their ease of use and  personal appeal, the number of blogs and range  of subject matter has exploded over recent years. Blogs have become a very  powerful communication medium and are likely to grow exponentially. </p>
      <p>Visitors  to a blog can often contribute their thoughts and help build the content. Blogs  can also draw upon content from other blogs (referred to as syndication from an  RSS &ldquo;feed&rdquo;). For this reason, blogs have become a powerful medium for  establishing web communities and special interest groups. </p>
      <h3>Features      </h3>
      <p>Blogs can be characterised by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a journal style of presentation, including the dates and times of blog entries. Most recent entries are usually listed first</li>
        <li>frequent (often daily) updates</li>
        <li>an informal, converstaional style</li>
        <li>the diversity of subject matter, often including brief  musings, commentary on internet and other social issues</li>
        <li>additional commentary contributed by blog visitors </li>
        <li>links to other blogs and websites.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Blogs invite readers to comment on  what a user has written or posted. Blogs enable user to include link to web  sites, other blogs, news articles, or even pictures. Blogs can also be used to  embed video and audio from video sharing and podcasting sites. <br />
        Blog writers can also &ldquo;tag&rdquo; their entries with  keywords. Keywords are a kind of category for blog posts. This allows posts to  be viewed (and searched) by users by category as well as by the date they were  posted.</p>
      <p><strong>Text blogs</strong></p>
      <p>There are many  free blogging sites available where you can register and create your blog.  Three popular sites are:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Blogger <a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.blogger.com</a></li>
        <li>Wordpress <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.wordpress.com</a></li>
        <li>edublogs <a href="http://edublogs.org/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://edublogs.org</a>. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Photo blogs</strong></p>
      <p>A photo blog is a type of weblog (or 'blog') that is based  on uploaded photos or images. Although photography is the main focus, other  features such as text-based or audio comments may be added. Photos and images  are powerful tools for inviting responses from other photo blog participants. <br />
        <a href="http://www0.fotolog.com/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www0.fotolog.com/</a></p>
      <p><strong>Moblogs</strong></p>
      <p>Moblogs accepts photos from a  mobile phone. Photos, audio, and text files can be posted to a moblog site.<br />
      <a href="http://moblog.co.uk/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://moblog.co.uk/</a></p>
      <p><strong>Vidblogs</strong></p>
      <p>Vidblogs use video rather than text or audio. Videoblogging offers a  rich experience by combining movies, sound, still images, and text. New  technologies make images and video easy to produce.&nbsp;<br />
      <u><a href="http://www.vidblogs.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.vidblogs.com/</a></u></p>
      <p><strong>RSS and blogs</strong></p>
      <p>Like  other web  tools such social bookmarking sites, podcasts and wikis â€” blogs generate a  &quot;news feed&quot; (or &quot;RSS feed&quot;, or simply &quot;feed&quot;) so that readers can &quot;subscribe&quot; to the receive the content created in a particular blog without directly visiting the blog. </p>
      <p>To view the feeds, you need to use an aggregator (also known as feedreader or  newsreader) which collects  feeds from many sites and present them on single page in a readable format. This means you don't have to view each individual blog to keep up to date with content. <br />
        RSS feeds have  important applications for  teachers and trainers using blogs with their learners. They can keep up  to date with learners' blog postings by  subscribing to their learners'  feeds and simply checking their aggregators regularly.<br />

      <h3>Teaching and learning opportunities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>As an informational/instructional resource </li>
        <li>For frequently asked questions and other course updates </li>
        <li>As a tool for learners to establish their own journals,       portfolios and personal reflections for presentation to their teachers and       peers </li>
        <li>A course/subject journal compiled over the period of delivery       with course related reflections </li>
        <li>To showcase personal works and achievements (eg an arts       portfolio) </li>
        <li>To contribute to a wider body of       knowledge (eg eople from beyond your provider can benefit from reading your       blog) </li>
        <li>As a class portal where learners can       access supplemental materials, curriculum, links, videos, podcasts, homework,       assessment task and other peer/trainer feedback </li>
        <li>As an ongoing content where materials       and resources can be archived online for easy locating in the future. </li>
        <li>To establish a curriculum vitae </li>
        <li>As the basis of an assessment.</li>
      </ul>

	</div>
    <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating blogs </h2>
      <p>Blogs  can be used for multiple purposes. With this in mind you need to make sure your  learners are clear about the purpose of the blog and its intended use. Blogs  allow for regular updating. They are often best used as an informal  communication tool. </p>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Plan and design how a blog fits into your learning program. </li>
        <li>Decide on where your blog will be hosted (see Resources section). </li>
        <li>Set up the blog prior to course commencement. </li>
        <li>Negotiate or define with your learners how the blog will be used.       This could include:
          <ol>
            <li>Purpose of the blog in the learning program </li>
            <li>Acceptable use and guidelines for posting </li>
            <li>Frequency of updates required. </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Remind learners that blogs are designed to be <strong>publically accessible</strong>.       Learners do not need to login to view materials. Discretion should be used       when publishing private and confidential materials. There is no control       over intellectual property. Trainers should discuss privacy issues in       detail before allowing their learners to blog. </li>
        <li>Clearly define the purpose, expected outcomes and assessment       requirements (if applicable). </li>
        <li>Blogs display what your learners&rsquo;       produce, warts and all. Learners will misspell words and use poor grammar.       Work with their learners on this and form strategies to should learner be       sensitive about their spelling or composition. </li>
        <li>Provide guidance to learners on the type of work that should be       included in the blog. Consider using the inbuilt commenting feature to       provide individualised feedback. </li>
        <li>Encourage learners to be adventurous with their posts and the       type of items they post there including video, audio, text, links and       other blog posts. Learners can delete or edit anything after it has been       posted on a blog.</li>

        <li>Remind  learners that visitors can post feedback on sites. Such comments to blog can be  moderated if you are worried about abuses from outsiders. You can choose to  approve all comments, rather than allowing comments to automatically appear. </li>
      </ol>
      <ol start="11" type="1">
        <li>As a group search for and visit other learners       blogs. Post comments and invite exchanges through the respective blogs. Build       trust between the two groups and propose collaboration through blogs       around a shared activity.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Generic skills      </h3>
      <p>Blogs can be used to create  a portfolio of generic or employablity skills gained over a course of study. This could serve as an exit product for future employment. Learners will be developing their communication skills as they participate in the blog. </p>
      <h3>Assessment      </h3>
      <p>If using blogs in assessment you need to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be clear on the competencies, generic skills, performance criteria that need to be demonstrated. Items within the blog should have the potential to demonstrate these competencies. </li>
        <li>Ensure that guidelines for the development, compilation and submission of blog are clearly stated.</li>
        <li> Consider online options for offering feedback on the blog.</li>
        <li>Develop an electronic proforma or rubric that will aid in the assessment of the blog. As each blog is likely to be unique this is sometimes difficult to frame but is critical in ensuring a fair and valid assessment process. The following website allows the user to  develop a rubric electronically:
          <ul>
            <li>Thinking Gear <a href="http://www.thinkinggear.com/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.thinkinggear.com/</a></li>
          </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One of the advantages of blogs  over many other web-based technologies is that they require no specific software to be installed (other than a web browser). They are easy to use and update. </li>
        <li>There are several different blogging technologies (see resources section below). They have subtle differences in look, behaviour and functionality. </li>
        <li>Become familiar with the way that your blog works. Plan to induct the learners. </li>
        <li>You will need to understand some basic html if you want to make       changes to blog templates or you want to embed video, audio and       slideshares from other social networking sites.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Skills      </h3>
      <p>You are likley to need good instructional and organisational skills, particularly if you plan to use  blogs for learner journals or assessment. Leaners are likely to require a high level of  support, particularly when setting up  their  blogs. </p>
