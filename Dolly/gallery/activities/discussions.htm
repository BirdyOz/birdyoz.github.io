      <div id="why">
      <h2>Why include discussions?</h2>
      <p>Collaboration with teachers and other learners is often a key feature of effective learning environments. Online discussion activities on conference or bulletin boards can develop a collaborative environment and reduce the alienation of learners studying at a distance. Discussion activities can become the communications hub of your online teaching program. </p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>allows learners and teachers to communicate at any time or place</li>
        <li>builds a learning community </li>
        <li>creates an archive of course communication</li>
        <li>allows learners time to reflect on postings and prepare suitable messages</li>
        <li>reduces the time need to respond to individual learners via email.</li>
        </ul>
          <p>Discussion  activities can be text or voice based and is generally used to support  asynchronous learning. Asynchronous learning involves the ability for trainers  and learners to maintain communication without having to meet at the same place  at the same time. </p>
          <p>Discussion activities can be  undertaken using a variety of methods:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Discussion forums</strong> <br />
              (known also by various other names such as <em>discussion group</em>, <em>discussion  forum</em>, <em>message board</em>, and <em>online forum</em>) <br />
              Discussion Forum is a general term for any online &quot;bulletin board&quot;  where Trainers and Learners can leave and expect to see responses to messages  others have left. Or Users can just read the board. </li>
            <li><strong>Voice boards</strong><br />
              Are similar to discussion forums but allow you to create threaded discussions  by recording yopur comments as audio messages. Like text discussion boards, users can post a voice message  and then others can listen to it later and respond in voice and text. </li>
            <li><strong>Instant Messaging</strong><br />
              IM is a form of online communication that allows  real-time (or close to real-time) interaction through personal computers or  mobile computing devices. Users can exchange messages privately, similar to  e-mail, or join group conversations. While typed text remains the primary  convention for IM, the technology has allows users to send images, audio and  video files, and other attachments to their contacts. </li>
            <li><strong>Comments posted to wikis or  blogs<br />
            </strong>Blogs are an easy to update web-based system  that allows for online journals, diaries, portfolios and web communities. Wikis  are a website resource which allows users to add and edit content collectively.  Both blogs and wikis allow visitors and web users to post comments and feedback  to content posted there.</li>
        </ul>
          <p>A list of  these tools can be found at <a href="http://www.cooltools.net.au/communication.htm"target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.cooltools.net.au/communication.htm</a></p>
          <h3>Teaching and learning opportunities</h3>
          <p>The range of types of discussion activities is endless but typically teachers have used discussions for the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>posting messages and instructions that apply to all learners</li>
        <li>engaging learners in warm-up activities</li>
        <li>creating problem-based learning environments (<a href="debates.htm">debates</a>, <a href="roleplay.htm">roleplays</a>, <a href="problem_based.htm">problem-based</a> activities, <a href="projects.htm">projects</a>, feedback and findings on <a href="research.htm">research</a> activities etc)</li>
        <li>providing opportunities for learners to <a href="presentations.htm">present their projects </a>or record a <a href="journals.htm">journal</a></li>
        <li>getting feedback and evaluation on the course</li>
        <li>monitoring and <a href="../support/communication.htm">managing the communication</a> of learners.</li>

    <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating discussions</h2>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <ol>
            <li>Consider the range of  communication activities within the course. </li>
            <li>Decide if discussion  participation will be assessable (see below for more information on  assessment). </li>
            <li>Provide instruction or a  simple activity (for example, introductions and personal course goal  statements) to ensure that your knows the know  how to post messages </li>
            <li>Set up 'seed' messages to get  learners started and to outline the purpose of each thread/topic. Develop activities to make sure everyone knows and feels  comfortable with each other </li>
            <li>Establish with the learners some ground rules about etiquette,  manner, and respect for others and their opinions </li>
            <li>Give learners some guidelines about the length and frequency  of posts (i.e. discourage lengthy, verbose posts, post no more than 2 messages  in a row without others response etc) </li>
            <li>Consider establishing smaller groups so that people's opinions  have a smaller audience and the threads are easier to follow and respond to by  learners </li>
            <li>Set up the discussion space to  facilitate these activities (structure threads, allocate teams and private  spaces etc). </li>
            <li>Constantly monitor the  discussion and respond to or initiate discussions where necessary. </li>
            <li>Contact learners who are not participating, reading but not post  (&ldquo;lurkers&rdquo;) or who are responding inappropriately to the task. </li>
            <li>Summarise or &ldquo;weave&rdquo; discussion threads and post a summary that  makes linkages to other aspects of the learning program. It can become  difficult for learners to follow the communication that is taking place on the  forum. Weaving is where you post messages that help students understand how a  discussion is flowing and its relationship to previous discussion. Use weaving  to review print outs, refer to earlier discussions, clarify confused content  understanding or arguments, identify themes and make connections between posts.</li>
            <li>Archive and save the post for later review/assessment recording </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>Participation in discussion activities can form the basis of an assessment task.


 If you are intending to use contributions to discussion forums or chat for assessment purposes you should clearly outline to the learners how you will be assessing their online contributions.</p>
      <p>Trainers often report  that&nbsp; learner participation in discussion  forums their subject can&nbsp; be quite low  unless they provide an assessment or participation incentive that encourages  students to read and post messages. </p>
      <p> We have prepared a Word document as an example of a document that may be given to learners prior to the commencement of a course outlining the assessment criteria for the discussion activity. You may wish to modify it for your own purposes and context. </p>
      <p><a href="../../assessing/downloads/C2_assessing_discussions.doc" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Discussion activity assessment rubric</a> (Word document) </p>
      <p>For  more ideas on integrating assessment into discussion activities visit <a href="http://www.csu.edu.au/division/landt/resources/documents/celt_4.pdf" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.csu.edu.au/division/landt/resources/documents/celt_4.pdf</a></p>
      <p>Most discussion forums technologies allow you to create a compiled list of an individual's contributions which can be used in assessment. </p>
      <h3>Generic skills</h3>
      <p>Discussion activities offer extremely rich opportunities to foster generic skills. Activities within the discussion board may involve:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>working in pairs or <strong>teams</strong> in private threads (defining the roles in the team, crisis management, giving feedback to other team members)</li>
        <li><strong>problem solving</strong> and offering solutions to issues posed in the discussion (developing creative and innovative solutions, applying a range of strategies to solve problems) </li>
        <li><strong>communication skills</strong> (writing which is appropriate to the audience, persuading effectively, sharing information, asking for clarification, agreeing and disagreeing) </li>
        <li>effective use of <strong>technology</strong>. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <p>You will need access to an online discussion tool provided by your organisation&nbsp;in a  Learner Management System by your organisation ((WebCT, Blackboard, Janison, WebBoard). Alternatively you can access a huge range of  web-based sites  such as <a href="http://au.groups.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Groups</a> or <a href="http://www.phpbbforumz.com/">Messenger</a>, or <a href="http://im.live.com/messenger/im/home/?source=MSNTDLINK">MSN Live  Messenger</a> or <a href="http://www.phpbbforumz.com/">phBB</a>.  Generally the technical skills required to moderate a discussion are at the low end and are a good way into online learning for teachers. </p>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>You will need skills in:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>setting up the online discussion environment (setting up threads, allocating learners to private groups, managing messages, navigating messages etc)</li>
        <li>moderating the discussion activities (e-moderation). </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Moderating a discussion in an online environment is now called <strong>e-moderation</strong>. The role of the teacher as an e-moderator is to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>provide the rules of the discussion (value what others say, don't interrupt etc)</li>
        <li>offer an opening gambit, the provocative statement, scene setting</li>
        <li>rephrase what students have  said to ensure their point is clearly stated, if necessary</li>
        <li>provide links from one aspect of the discussion to the other</li>
        <li>draw together the disparate threads of the discussion to form a conclusion. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These e-moderation techniques are critically important to the success of online learning. </p>
