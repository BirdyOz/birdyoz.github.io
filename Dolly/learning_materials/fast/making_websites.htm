      <h1>Making websites</h1>
      <p class="note">The simplest form of e-learning  materials</p>
      <p>The most common way of preparing e-learning  resources is in the form of web pages within a web site. This is usually a  series of web pages (HTML files) that are linked together using a navigation  system. The pages themselves contain information in the form of text, images  and some types of multimedia. You can also place interactive elements in your  pages to add a level of participant activity and engagement.</p>
      <p>Once you have created your web pages they can  be uploaded to a web server or LMS so your students can access them.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the fastest way of creating an  e-learning resource is to provide links to existing web sites and resources  into your web site. The pages you prepare can create the context and the  instructions for the students and provide hyper links to the resources that  already exist on the internet. It is important to realize that these links may  become obsolete as web sites often change their addresses or are removed from  the web.</p>
      <p>The following sections provide you with some  rules of thumb when designing your pages and techniques you can use to create  your e-learning materials.</p>
      <h2>Using an HTML Editor</h2>
      <p>Using an HTML editor is not much different  from using a Word Processor. There are a few differences, however, that you  will need to be aware of. </p>
      <p>The following are some tips on how to create  web pages using an HTML editor:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Adding text
          </strong>
          <ol>
            <li>Structure the text using heading styles  (ie Heading 1, Heading 2 etc). You can use a style sheet to redefine what the  headings look like. Doing this will make your web pages more accessible.</li>
            <li>Keep the length of any one web page to  about 1½  to 2 screens to minimise  scrolling.</li>
            <li>You can copy and paste text from a word  processor into your web pages.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Adding images</strong><br />
  The web is a visual medium. Where possible it  is a good idea to include some appropriate images to provide visual support for  your content. Be careful, however, not to add images just for the sake of it.  This can be very distracting and annoying if over done.
    <ol>
      <li>Make sure images are the correct size  before you insert them in your web pages. Large image file sizes will take a  long time to download even if you have changed their size in the web page.</li>
      <li>Add 'alt' text for the images to improve  accessibility.<br />
        You should always add a short title or  description to your image so that people who use screen readers can receive  information about the images on the page. Some HTML editor programs will not  allow you to add an image without adding an 'alt' tag to the image.</li>
      <li>You can add a hyperlink to an image.  This is a good way of making an interactive navigation system for your web  pages.</li>
    </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Adding media elements</strong><br />
        Probably the simplest type of multimedia you can  add to your resources is a Flash movie. Your HTML editor may have a menu item  for adding or “embedding” media files in your web page.</li>
        <li><strong>Lay out text in tables</strong><br />
          Simply adding text and images to a web page  does not make it look engaging. One way of laying out your content is to lay it  out using tables. Whilst this is not the accepted way of laying out content, it  can be used if your students do not use screen readers or have other  accessibility requirements. The correct way to layout content in a web page is  to use cascading style sheets, but this is not a task for people who are just  starting out in creating e-learning content.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Adding interactive elements</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Adding hyperlinks</strong><br />
          There are a number of simple ways in which  you can interactivity to a web page. Using the hyperlink function allows the  student to move around your e-learning resources by clicking on links.<br />
          You can use images or words  and then use  the link function in your HTML editor program. If you want the link to open in  a new window select the ‘target =&quot;_blank&quot;’  option. <br />
          Some HTML editor programs allow you to add an  ‘image map’ to your web page. An image map allows you to draw one or more  shapes over an image and link these to specific web pages. An example use of  this strategy could be placing image maps over different parts of a piece of  machinery. These images maps open a new window that is link to pages that  explain the functions of each part of the machinery. <br />
        If you are starting with a Microsoft Word  document, from which  you wish to produce  a web page, you can use Course Genie which adds a range of interactive  functions to the web pages. Refer to the section on 'Assemble it' which  describes the use of specific programs to convert word to html.</li>
        <li><strong>Using form elements</strong><br />
          Form elements can add a level of  interactivity to your web pages by allowing the students to select options or  enter text to the web page.<br />
        Form elements include check boxes, text entry  boxes, drop down menus and submission buttons. To provide feedback, based on  the entries or selections made, you would need to develop JavaScript programs  to be included in the page. To do this you may need to ask a person who has  knowledge of JavaScript programming to assist you. </li>
        <li><strong>Using layers to move images on the  screen </strong><br />
          A  layer is a web page element that can have particular properties. One of the  features of a layer is that it can be made 'draggable'. This means objects on  the screen can be clicked on and then moved around the web page. Once again  this requires JavaScript to be added to the page. An example of this type of  script, and how to use it your web pages, is located at Dynamic Drive DHTML web  site
          <em><a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/image3.htm" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/image3.htm</a>.<br />
        </em>It is also possible to create JavaScript  responses to actions carried out on the draggable layer, such a dropping the  image in a layer on a target. This lets you build games that provide feedback  based on a students interaction with the elements on the web page. Once again  this will require a knowledge of JavaScript programming.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The following are programs that allow you to create  web pages and web sites very simply.</p>
      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>WebDwarf </strong><a href="http://www.virtualmechanics.com/products/dwarf/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.virtualmechanics.com/products/dwarf/</a><br />
          WebDwarf allows you add content and lay it out very simply  without the use of tables. You can place your content on the page and drag it  to where you want it located. When you are satisfied with the layout of  specific elements of content you can lock the content and then add more items  to your web pages.</li>
        <li><strong><em>eXe</em></strong>  <a href="http://exelearning.org/?q=downloads" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://exelearning.org/?q=downloads</a><br />
          eXe stands for E-Learning XHTML Editor.  This is a web authoring environment that takes very little learning and can  produce very powerful and engaging resources. The eXe environment has easy to use  iDevices (Instructional Devices) which allow you to add a range of  functionalities to your web pages. iDevices include assessment questions, case  studies, cloze activities, external websites, image galleries, image magnifier,  java applets, objectives, preknowledge, rss, reflections, wiki articles.<br />
          The e-learning  resources you produce can be exported as a web site or IMS SCORM learning  package ready to be uploaded to your learning management system.</li>
