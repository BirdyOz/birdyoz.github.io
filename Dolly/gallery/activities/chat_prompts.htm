<h1>Some prompts used for copying and
  pasting during the chat</h1>
<p>Let's start by reviewing the scenario for this chat.</p>
<p>A teacher in your department has spent the last three
  years developing their online WebCT course. The
  course includes lots of Flash animations, interactive graphics and PDF
  documents. The course is due to be delivered for the beginning of next
  semester.</p>
<p>The head of your department has spoken to the teacher and advised them that
  one of the students recently enrolled in the course is a blind
  student who lives in the country and is studying off-campus. This student like all others will require
  access to the online resources.</p>
<p><strong><span style='color:#CC0000'>The first part of the chat is to use
  &quot;red hat&quot; thinking.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style='color:#CC0000'>The red hat has to do with feelings,
  intuition, hunches, and emotions. </span></strong><br />
  The red hat gives people
  permission to put forward their feelings and intuitions without apology,
  without explanation, and without any need to justify them.</p>
<p>...Putting on my red hat, this is what I feel about the project.</p>
<p>...My gut-feeling is that it will not work.</p>
<p>...I don't like the way this is being done.</p>
<p>...My intuition tells me that prices will fall soon.</p>
<p><strong>Now let's move onto the black hat.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The black hat is the &quot;caution&quot; hat. </strong><br />
  The black hat prevents us from making mistakes, doing silly things, and doing things
  which might be illegal. <br />
  The black hat is for critical judgment, for pointing
  out why something cannot be done.</p>
<p><strong>Time to change
  again. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The<span
style='color:#FFCC00'> yellow hat</span> is for
    optimism and the logical positive view of things</strong>.<br />
  The
    yellow hat looks for feasibility and how something can be done. The
yellow hat looks for benefits â€” but they must be logically based.</p>
<p><strong><span style='color:#00CC33'>Lastly let's try the green hat. The
  green hat is for creative thinking and new ideas. </span></strong><br />
  The green hat
  is for additional alternatives and for putting forward possibilities and
  hypotheses. The green hat requests creative effort.</p>
