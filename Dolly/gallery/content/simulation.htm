The goal is simple: choose a season, pick an order and grow the plants to fill it! The simulation environment encourages experimentation with different interventions and effective task prioritisation to achieve the largest yield.

      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include simulations?</h2>
        <p>Online simulations are useful in that they:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>assist in the development of big ideas and concepts</li>
          <li>allow learners to make decisions in a safe environment, before exposing  them to potentially risky or dangerous sitiuations</li>
          <li>allow access to spaces, time frames and variables which are not easily accessed by all learners in real time.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Simulations are likely to deal with a number of competencies and tasks in an integrated way. They require learners to bring together a range of skills and knowledge in a problem-solving activity. </p>
        <a href="simulation.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a> </div>
      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating simulations</h2>
        <p>You can use simulations within a range of online and classroom experiences. You can  use  simulations to present content and provide examples, initiate discussions or create an exploratory learning experience. Simulations can also be used as a starting point for investigation and research in the topic area.</p>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <p>Building a simulation is a complex and lengthy process and typically involves a whole design team. There are a number of aspects to building simulations. They involve:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> having a clear understanding of what it is that you would like students to learn</li>
          <li>knowing what you would like your learners to experience</li>
          <li>coming up with a design metaphor</li>
          <li>considering the types of input that will be required from learners (matching exercises, multiple choice, turn based etc)</li>
          <li>creating the calculations which work in the background to process the learner input </li>
          <li>developing the feedback that will be given to learners </li>
          <li>developing multimedia, audi and video clips which will enhance the experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>Sophisticated simulations allow for assessment. Learners are required to register and complete within a specified time. This could form part of an assessable task. More often simulations are used to form pasrt of a self assessment process for learners, allowing them to practice applying skills and knowledge to a complex situation. </p>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>Implementing simulations may involve placing files on a server or  using a CD. Others may be web based and only require Shockwave or Flash player.  There are a variety of software packages available  specifically to develop simulations. See the <strong>Resources</strong> section.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Designing and developing simulations is a complex task and is generally not within the scope of the average teacher. If you are lucky you may be able to access a simulation that has been designed for your subject area. Try  <a href="http://lorn.flexiblelearning.net.au/Home.aspx">LORN</a>  for learning objects that include  simulations.</p>
