        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Interactivity
              is touted as one of the most valuable features of online
            learning. However, a cursory examination of most instructional offerings
            on the web, reveals that much of the provided interactivity is of
          the variety that only connects the learner with the content.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
            web offers much more than people-to-computer interaction. Communications
              technologies like email, discussion forums, and chat, offer unique
              opportunities
              for instructional strategies that encourage learner-to-learner
            and
          learner-to-facilitator interaction.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through
            the use of open-ended questions and people-to-people interaction,
            web-based games can be
              used to create content, check participant
                understanding, and for roleplay and simulations to solve problems
                collaboratively. In
                web-based games, the facilitator and players communicate with
            each other by sending email notes and using the forum and chat to
            contribute,
                synthesise
                and debrief. Web-based games are serious fun and offer a challenging
                way to process open-ended, divergent questions that require application,
                analysis
          and synthesis.</font></p>

            Jasinski paired up with Sivasailam &quot;Thiagi&quot; Thiagarajan
            to co-facilitate the Playhouse games. Thiagi was based in Indiana,
            USA. For the past 30 years, Thiagi has been designing and facilitating
            training games for corporate employees that encourage meaningful
            people-to-people interaction through the use of open-ended questions.
            He has used these types of questions and interactions not only to
            check participants' understanding but also help them create content.
            For the past few years,Thiagi has been applying the same principles

            the Playhouse, framegames were played. Framegames provide templates
            for instant creation of games for learning. The generic frameworks
            are deliberately designed to permit easy replacement of old content
            with new. In other words, the content changes, but the process stays
            the same. Framegames are quite versatile and transferable to different
            contexts. Playhouse players can easily modify the games for use in
            their own context.</font></p>

            five players participated in two role play games using email and
            the forum. In the early rounds of both games, the facilitators communicate
            with each player via email. Players generate and process the content
            without interacting with each other. In later rounds, players comment
            on the synthesised content and debrief together in the online discussion
            forum.</font></p>

              1: Depolariser - Do teachers want to give up centre stage?</b><br>
    Depolariser is a role play game using email and the forum. It explored the
    question:Do teachers want to give up centre stage? Through a six round series
    lasting about a week, players explore this issue from both a personal perspective
    and also from a designated role.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Depolariser
            is based on the philosophy that many issues that we treat as problems
            to be solved are actually polarities to be managed. The game begins
            by having players think about their opinions regarding a selected
            polarising issue (in this case, teachers' willingness to give up
            the centre stage). By informing the players about the average and
            range of positions, we increase their awareness of the spread of
            opinions around the issue. By having players randomly role-play,
            we encourage them to think about different points of view. By reviewing
            extremely polarised comments, we help players make more informed
            decisions. The game seems to encourage players at extremes to get
            closer to the average. We may not change anyone's opinion, but we
            increase their level of awareness about alternative points of view
            by playing the Depolariser game.</font></p>

              2: Galactic Wormhole - The Future of Online Learning in VET</b><br>
    In this roleplay game, players participated in a time-travel scenario to
    explore the status of online learning in VET in the year 2004. They were
    given either a Utopian or a Dystopian scenario based on a newspaper headline
    either:</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>Utopia

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Players
            were randomly assigned a scenario and a stakeholder role of either
            teacher, learner, manager, ANTA decision maker or industry client.
            Each player was then asked to submit a 150 word story outlining how
            their stakeholder contributed to either this utopian or dystopian
            future for online learning in VET.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These
            scenarios were submitted anonymously to the facilitator who collated
            and posted them in the Playhouse forum. After reviewing all the scenarios
            for both positions, players submitted their five top ideas for ensuring
            a utopian future for online learning in VET. From the list of 45
            ideas submitted, players then voted on the five top issues that needed
            to be addressed to ensure a utopian future for online learning in
            VET.</font></p>

              understand the use of email and lack of contact with other players

              the next step and making it 'safe' to be extreme. It reduced the

              I thought showed how the same aims of opening out perspectives
              on a subject could/should be achieved in new ways with new technologies.
              It was also pleasant to see someone actually use technology in
