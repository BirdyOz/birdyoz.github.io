    <div id="why">
        <h2>Why use learning management systems?</h2>
        <p>An LMS&nbsp; is a high-level, strategic solution for  planning, delivering, and managing most learning events within an organisation,  and the selection and deployment of an LMS learning soulution needs to be  carefully considered. <br />
Providers in some states have access  to a state sponsored and managed LMS to enable access to an online delivery  system (for example Blackboard in Victoria and  Tasmania,  Janison in NSW). <br />
LMS give trainers the option of a  whole-of-course delivery platform:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>different  tools are integrated in a single system which offers all necessary tools to run  and manage an e-learning course</li>
          <li>all learning  activities and materials in a course are organised and managed by and within  the system </li>
          <li>options are provided for discussion  forums, file sharing, management of assignments, lesson plans, syllabus, chat,  etc. </li>
          <li>content can be shared and be  reused by trainers within the provider </li>
          <li>LMS provide systems for recording  assessment and providing feedback to learners </li>
          <li>LMS can be used to share a variety  of learning objects either created by the Crown (for example, Flexible Learning  Toolboxes) or commercial organisations. </li>
          <li>Trainers what range of content and  activities are delivered from an LMS in tandem with other blended or face to  face methods </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When considering the use of an  LMS:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>What learner information do you want the LMS to       track? </li>
          <li>Will you be able to customise it to your needs? </li>
          <li>Will you easily be able to add or delete       learners and courses, and use the other features of the software? </li>
          <li>Does it need to connect to other information in       your organisation, such as enrolment, fees and assessment records? </li>
          <li>What will it cost, and how are the charges       applied? </li>
          <li>Should it also have a content management       capability? </li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>The characteristics shared    by most LMSs include:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Learning/teaching    tools
                    <ul>
                      <li>online    assessment and grading options </li>
                      <li>grade    reporting tool (to allow learner to view assessment results) </li>
                      <li>quiz/survey    tool </li>
                      <li>course    backup, download, and upload facilities </li>
                      <li>learner    group administration tools (for breaking up tasks into smaller groups)</li>
                      <li>learner    access tracking (how many articles have they posted/read, which pages have they    accessed/how many tasks have been submitted?) </li>
                      <li>tracking (showing how many learners have accessed a page, and when did) </li>
                      <li>web-based    file management </li>
                      <li>course    glossary building tool </li>

                  </li>
                  <li>Course    announcements and calendar administration tool </li>
                  <li>Manage users, roles, courses, instructors,    and facilities and generate reports</li>
                  <li>Course calendar</li>
                  <li>Learner messaging and notifications</li>

                  <li>Grading of coursework </li>
                  <li>Web-based or blended course delivery </li>
                  <li>Typical    features forlLearners include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>self-evaluations </li>
                      <li>learner    accounts for web publishing </li>
                      <li>group work    areas for collaborative web publishing </li>
                      <li>course    content annotation facility and bookmarks </li>

                      <li>real-time    chat rooms </li>
                      <li>real-time    white boards </li>
                      <li>individual    grade and progress status reports </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              <p>Almost all systems now support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Management_System" target="blank">IMS</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCORM" target="blank">SCORM</a> content packaging and SCORM runtime. This ensures that content developed to these standards will be redcognised by the LMS.</p>
              <p>There    are many LMS systems but some common ones in use in Australia    include:</p>

              <h3>Teaching and learning    opportunities</h3>
              <p>Trainers  can use an LMS to deliver an entire course or components of a course. Because  of the range of tools available, trainers can assemble training deliveries that  reflect their learners&rsquo; needs, distance from the provider and technological  literacy. <br />
Trainers  can use an LMS to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>post messages and instructions  that apply to all learners</li>
                <li>engage learners in warm-up  activities</li>
                <li>create problem-based learning  environments <br />

                <li>provide course content in a  variety of media &ndash; including text and multimedia.</li>
                <li>provide a course &ldquo;home&rdquo; online  while providing activities beyond the LMS for use with wikis, blogs, podcasts,  social bookmarking etc.</li>
                <li>supply links to external resources</li>
                <li>provide opportunities for learners  to <a href="presentations.htm">present their  projects </a>or record a <a href="journals.htm">journal</a></li>
                <li>archive voice tutorials  conducted with learners in virtual classroom</li>

        <h2>Integrating learning management systems </h2>
        <p>Trainers should ensure learners are clear about the  purpose of the learning management system and its intended use. LMS can be used  to deliver whole or part deliveries based on the mode of delivery by a trainer  &ndash; fully online, blended, release, traineeship, face to face delivery. Carefully  consider and plan for the level of integration of LMS activities and  interactions into your existing training delivery.</p>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Enrol in a professional development program  where you experience the delivery of training from an LMS <u>as a learner  yourself.</u></li>
          <li>Prepare a  course plan that links activities in line with the mode of delivery for each  component &ndash; i.e. map which activities will learners be undertaking face to  face, through the LMS, on the job </li>
          <li>Start off  simply using only a few tools and consider using the LMS initially for a  component of your training delivery rather than the whole lot. </li>
          <li>Provide links to course content  or collaborative activities completed by previous learners that have been  undertaken using social networking tools such as blogs, wikis, social  bookmarking, podcasts etc. </li>
          <li>Select some communicative activities that  would enhance the online learning experience for your learners. For example: </li>
          <li>Set up discussion forums to  enable learners to connect with each other. </li>
          <li>Establish links to tools that  enable learners to contact their trainer through email, VoIP, phone etc. </li>
          <li>Plan how you will develop and distribute  course content </li>
          <li>Create your own content using the simple html  tools</li>
          <li>Make available Toolbox or other Learning  Objects</li>
          <li>Send out instructions on how to use the  learning management system and provide orientation activities that engage the  learner with the tools you will use throughout the course.</li>
          <li>Brief your learners on how the learning  management system will operate in a face-to-face session or through the use of  a virtual classroom session.</li>
          <li>Describe any collaborative activities and how  learners will use group tools to complete group activities assessments</li>
          <li>Consider using external tools to enable guest  speakers and workplace mentors to participate (virtual classrooms, blog with  feedback tool, training group collaborative wiki etc)</li>
          <li>Be prepared to manage the experience  proactively.</li>
          <li>Prepare your activities and resources in advance. </li>
          <li>Evaluate these  deliveries through regular surveys and small group conversations with your  learners.</li>
          <li>Refine  your approach to providing learning activities as you build new skills in  managing learners online.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Assessment        </h3>
        <p>The  range of tools available in an LMS lends itself to holistic assessment that  examines the level of integration of interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and  behaviors. Various assessment tasks can be used such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reflective  journal </li>
          <li>Research</li>
          <li>Work-based project report</li>
          <li>Engagment  with case studies and scenarios</li>
          <li>Collaboration</li>
          <li>Self  and peer assessment </li>
          <li>Presentations/demonstrations  of problem solving process and the solution </li>
          <li>Role  play </li>
          <li>Presentation  of videotape or multimedia website (i.e. podcast, video sharing etc). </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Generic skills</h3>
        <p>Communicating  with learners in online learning spaces has the potential to develop many of  the generic skills. Skillful trainer mediation will encourage learners to use  effective communication strategies, problem solving and to work collaboratively  with others.</p>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>Often the use of learning management systems will  require the end user to have plug-ins (Flash, Shockwave, audio and video  players, Java) installed on their computers. Increasingly these plug-ins are  standard on computer systems but you need to make sure that your learners can  download any software that is required to make the content contained within the  learning management system work properly. Test on a variety of computers and  provide handouts and phone support to learners who have difficulties.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>This includes  understanding how an LMS can be an integral part of the learning and teaching  experience, and developing skills in using appropriate development tools to  create meaningful online content. Consider finding a mentor in your provider  (or beyond) to shadow your skill development and to provide feedback and  suggestions on enhancing your learning environment.</p>
        <p>Using an LMS in a learning delivery is a high-level  skill involving software understanding, course and instructional design and an  ability to use virtual communication and conferencing tools and techniques with  learners. </p>
        <p>Using an LMS will involve a steep learning  curve for learners so be selective in choosing the tools you will use with your  learners to reflect their abilities. Design activities that provide for a  gentle introduction to the tools at the beginning of the course so learners are  comfortable with the environment before moving onto course content and other  interactions.<br />
          <strong>Communication skills </strong><br />
          <strong><em>Lynn Huguenin</em></strong> is Victorian based trainer with experience in using an LMS and virtual  classrooms with a variety of learners. Lyn&rsquo;s tips for ensuring the success of  an online course include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make  use of virtual classroom conferences to encourage learners to connect with each  other and to clarify learners&rsquo; engagement with course content.</li>
          <li>Provide  regular, individual feedback on performance in learning activities and  assessment tasks. </li>
          <li>Make  use of set timelines for assessment tasks. This also helps to keep learners on  track and prompts the idea of a group being connected by activities and not  individuals studying in isolation. </li>
          <li>To  keep learners on track, email or telephone participants who fall behind in  their assessment tasks. </li>
          <li>Promote  the idea of a supportive online community by having regular and consistent  online communication with learner. </li>
          <li>It would also help to have a basic understanding of how to  create html documents as well as an understanding of creating online content  (basic instructional design).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don&rsquo;t  try to learn everything at once. Trainers can achieve good results with LMS  with basic skills. Start off simply using only a few tools and only use the LMS  initially for a component of your training delivery rather than the whole lot.  Evaluate these deliveries and refine your approach as you build new skills. </p>
        <p><strong>Course  content development</strong></p>
        <p>Here are some suggested skills  to acquire to develop content development skills that meet your time and  learning delivery intentions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Getting  started<br />
          </strong>Locate learning  materials that are already available on the internet and make them available  from within the LMS (for example Toolbox materials). Learners&rsquo; access to this  material can still be tracked through the LMS tracking mechanisms. Trainers  should know how to create some basic tools in the LMS (creating links, adding a  discussion, adding a text or webpage, uploading files), use search engines,  download web pages, understand and use file formats (such as excel, pdf, word,  etc) and software. While some understanding of how to create an html document  is useful these can be created simply from within most LMS through the use of  webpage editing tools.</li>
          <li><strong>Intermediate  level<br />
          </strong>Trainers are using  webpage create tools (for example Dreamweaver) to create basic content and  simple exercises as well as editing toolbox or other learning object course  content to apply to their delivery context.&nbsp;  Trainers should know how to use a web authoring tool, have an understanding  of creating online content including Learning Object structure (basic  instructional design), the ability to create exercises from selected content,  using a word processor, copy and paste text, save files. </li>
          <li><strong>Advanced level<br />
          </strong>Trainers are creating advanced content and  exercises using specialised authoring software (for example   Dreamweaver, Director and Flash. Skills required at this level include  identifying the needs of the learner, some programming and design skills.)</li>
