        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">      During the past three years, we have designed, facilitated, and evaluated
                a series of Web-based games on a range of topics with over 1000 practitioners
                mostly within the vocational and corporate training sectors in Australia
                and the USA. These games incorporate research-based prescriptions from
                instructional design, game design, and online learning and facilitate
                dialogue between participants. Our observations and feedback from the
                players have led us to reinforce what we suspected: that unglamorous,
                low-tech but highly functional communications technology like email,
                bulletin boards, and chat can be used as primary tools to promote and
                encourage collaborative interactive learning online. This article documents
                our observations and experiences in the use of email games.</font></p>

              recent report on online training for corporate education (Dalton, 2000)
              identifies three basic types of
              strategies: HTML-formatted courses, live
            presentations and web conferencing. Of these, 79 percent of the clients
            report they use HTML content, 33 percent use live presentations and 26
            percent use conferencing strategies. The same group also identifies their
            biggest online learning challenge as &quot;uncompelling, static content&quot; associated
            with the HTML-content that is ironically used by the majority. </font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">        Email games are primarily containers for facilitating dialogue about
                    different problems and issues and for encouraging the construction
                    and sharing
                of new knowledge, understanding, perspectives, and insights. Three
                    sample email games are described in the next section. Our current
                    collection
                of 15 email games have all been structured on the basis of prescriptions
                from different disciplines including communication theory, complexity
                theory, cognitive sciences, and social psychology. Different sources
                for prescriptions used in the construction of these games are briefly
                outlined below under the three topics of instructional design, game
        design, and online learning.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Instructional
          Design Elements<br>
        </b>The
            core of email game templates contains real-world problems and issues
            that are salient to the players. Using a constructivist
                approach (Knuth &amp; Cunningham,
                  1993), an email game engages participants in interactive discussion
                of these problems and issues. Participants bring a variety of diverse
                experiences
                  and previous knowledge to the task and the facilitator selects
                and implements appropriate structures for different rounds of the
                game that encourage
                  the construction and sharing of new perspectives, knowledge,
                understandings and insights as suggested by Zhu (1998). Different
                email game templates
                  are designed to facilitate different types of learning outcomes
                as classified by Gagne (1985). The design, development, formative
                evaluation and revision
                  of the email games are carried out according to the Instructional
                Systems Design (ISD) model in its recent versions (Tessmer &amp; Wedman,
          1992 and Merrill, 1990). </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Game
            Design Elements<br>
        </b>All
            email game templates include the four critical attributes of a game
            (Thiagarajan, 1996): <em>conflict</em> (which prevents
              the
                    easy achievement
                      of a
                      specific goal), <em>control</em> (rules for taking turns and scoring
                    points), <em>closure</em> (special rules that specify how the game
            ends and who
                      wins) and <em>contrivance</em>
                      (an element of playfulness). While there are several types
                    of computer games for training (Prensky, in press), these
            games tend to represent
                      the categories of fact-recall tell-and-test variety at
            the one
                      end and elaborate
                      open-ended simulations on the other (Gredler, 1986). Email
                    games do not belong to either of these conventional categories
                    but
                      to a newer
                      knowledge-management
            approach labelled as structured sharing (Thiagarajan, 1998).</font></p>

        </b>A
            growing body of literature on computer-based and online learning
            approaches has contributed to the design of
                          our email game
                          templates. Of special
                          relevance to our work has been recent studies in the
                          area of electronic collaboration
                          (Bonk &amp; King, 1998). For example, a recent study
                          on Web-based case conferencing (Bonk, Malikowski, Angeli, &amp; East,
                          1998) has provided us data on the tendency of gradual
                          reductions in the quantity and significant
                          improvement in the quality of postings during later rounds
                          of iterative email discussions. Other findings from content
                          researchers (Kirkley, Savery, &amp; Grabner-Hogan,
                          1998) related to email's democratising effects, differences
                          between text-based communication and verbal communication,
                          scaffolding and support for learning,
                          types of feedback, and behavior patterns of lurkers,
                          have identified likely problems to be prevented and potentials
                          to be utilised. Current literature
                          on online learning has also provided us with validated
                          models and coding systems (Hara, Bonk, &amp; Angeli,
                          1998) for the content analysis of computer-mediated
                        communication.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Most
              people promote interactivity as the most valuable feature of online
                learning. Focused on the screen, hand on the mouse button, and
            leaning forward, learners are poised for interaction! There are many
            different
                classes of interaction (Gayeski, 1980) ranging all the way from
            clicking the mouse button to continue or to choose among options,
            to receiving
                personalised feedback and branching based on the computer creating
              a
                real-time model of the user. A closer look at many instructional
              offerings online reveals that much of this interactivity merely
            connects the learner
                with the content. We do not believe this is enough. Many adult
            educators agree that the most effective types of interactivity involve
            people-to-people
                connections. This model of learning as social collaboration is
        at the heart of email games.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In
            an email game, a facilitator and a group of players address a key
            issue by sending and receiving email messages during several
                  rounds of play spread
                over days or weeks. Typical email games exploit the ability of
              the internet to ignore geographic distances and capitalise on the
              ability
                  of participants
                to generate and process content. In the early rounds of play,
            the interaction is between players and the facilitator, while in
            later
              rounds, players
          come together to discuss processed content and to debrief.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In
            addition to training, we use email games for benchmarking and ideas-sharing
            activities. Some of our games have been played
                  in a professional development
                  context in the LearnScope Virtual Learning Community at <a href="email_games.html#" onMouseDown="MM_openBrWindow('http://www.learnscope.anta.gov.au','','')">www.learnscope.anta.gov.au</a>.
                  (LearnScope is a national Australian professional development
                  program aimed to encourage teachers and trainers in the vocational

                  and training
                  sector to utilise online technologies to achieve more flexible
                  learning.) Email games have also been played with members of

                  for Training and Development and the North American Simulation
                  and Gaming Association. In addition, we have created our own

                  of volunteer
                  players from different countries around the world. We also

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Here
            are brief descriptions of three email games.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Depolariser<br>
        </b>This
            role-playing game uses email and a bulletin board to produce more
            informed perception of controversial issues as its
                    learning outcome.
                        Depolariser is based on the philosophy that many issues
                    we treat as problems to be
                        solved are actually polarities to be managed. We begin
                    the game with an open-ended question (example: <em>Do lurkers
            learn?</em>). During
                        the six
                        rounds of the game, players explore this issue from both
                  a personal perspective
                        and also from a designated role. By informing the players
                  about the range of positions, we increase their awareness of
                    the
                        spread of opinions
                        around
                        the issue. By having players randomly role-play extreme
                    positions, we encourage
                        them to think about different points of view. By reviewing
                        extremely polarised comments, we help players make more
                    informed decisions.
                        The game typically
                        encourages players at extremes to get closer to the average.
                        Thus, it may not change anyone&#8217;s opinion, but it increases players&#8217; level
        of awareness of alternative points of view.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Galactic
            Wormhole</b> <br>The
            learning outcome from this email game is a higher-level analysis
            and understanding of factors that influence
                            specific positive
                            and negative consequences. In this roleplay game,
                players participate in a time-travel
                            scenario to explore an issue relevant to their context
                            (example: <em>the status
                            of online learning for vocational training in the
            year 2004</em>). Each player is given either a utopian scenario
                            in the form
                            of a newspaper
                            headline
                            (<em>Australian Vocational Education and Training
                            Sector Leads the World in Online Learning</em>) or a dystopian
                scenario (<em>Australian

            Players are randomly assigned one of these two scenarios and
                            given one
                            of

                            learner, manager, decision maker, or industry client.
                            Each player is then asked to submit a 150-word story
                            outlining
                            how his or
                            her designated
                            stakeholder
                            contributed to either this utopian or dystopian future.
                            These scenarios are submitted to the facilitator
            who collates and
                            posts them in a bulletin
                            board under the stakeholder role. After reviewing
            all the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios, players submit
                            their
                            five top ideas
                            for ensuring
                            a utopian future. Finally, players vote on critical
                issues that need to be addressed to ensure the utopian future,
                            then join

                              Poll Predict, Outcome.
                              In Round 1 of C3PO,
                              players receive an open-ended challenge (example:
                              <em>How do you increase person-to-person interaction
                              in internet-based

                              Each player
                              sends three ideas
                              to meet this challenge. In Round 2, the facilitator
                              sends the resulting pool of ideas back to the players
                              and asks
                              them to
                              generate a priority
                              list. Players read through the pool of ideas, select
                              the
                              three that personally appeal to them most, and
                  send them to the facilitator.
                              In
                              Round 3, players
                              review the original pool of ideas, make a prediction
                              of how the entire group would have voted and identify
                              the

                              have received
              the most votes. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> So
            during the Round 2 selection process, the players consider how they
            personally feel and react to
                                the ideas. During
                                the Round 3 prediction
                                process, the players put themselves in other
            players' positions and estimate the
                                reaction of the population. As one player put
            it, <em>&quot;The prediction
                                step forces you to stop thinking wishfully, projecting your preferences,
                                and become absolutely objective&#8221;</em>. The player
                                with the closest prediction is the winner! After
                                the results are announced, players participate

      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
              heart of the matter for a successful email game is effective facilitation.
              Although players generate and process the content, the
                facilitator orchestrates
                the game. Email games change the role of the teacher to a designer
              and facilitator of learning activities rather than a content expert.
              To provide
                a seamless email game, facilitation requires technical, administrative,
                interpersonal and instructional design functions. <br>
        Here&#8217;s a quick look at these factors.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Technical</b><br>
          Facilitators
            need a working knowledge of the communication technologies they will
            be using to play virtual games as well as spreadsheets
                  for data management. If players experience technical difficulties
                  or
                  get confused
                with the forum software, they will most often turn to the facilitator
                  for assistance. Developing a FAQ response file allows the facilitator
                  to be
                responsive to most queries.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Administrative</b><br>
          As
            responses to email games arrive they must be processed quickly and
            accurately in preparation for the next round of play. Accurate
                  and
                  systematic record
                  keeping, like player tracking, collation of input, and sending
                  out of next rounds are critical to the smooth flow of email
                  games. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Interpersonal</b><br>
          While
            the game templates provide the steps needed to play a game, facilitating
            a game is more than a mechanical process.
                    Setting
                    the scene, sustaining
                    motivation, and debriefing relies on the human factor and
                  a fair degree of interpersonal skill. Facilitators need to
                  monitor
                    the
                    progress of
                    a game and determine when to change pace, contact individual
                    players and
                    change the tone of the play. Player participation patterns
                    vary. Some players reply promptly, others leave it to the
                  last minute,
                    some miss
                    rounds but
                    contribute to others and some will register and observe but
                    never actively contribute. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Instructional
            Design</b><br>
          Email games lend themselves to a dynamic instructional process.
                      The facilitator is close to the players and in a position
                      to be responsive
                      to feedback.
                      As the games are played in rounds, it is easy to use a
              just-in-time instructional design process. If something is not
              working,
                      it can readily be changed.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Our
              open-platform approach of inviting colleagues to use our e-game templates
                in return for sharing their results and modifications, has encouraged
                spontaneous adoption and improvement of this instructional methodology.
                While we are excited about creating new e-game structures and templates,
                we also realise the importance of a systematic study of the factors
              that
                influence the process and outcomes of email games. We invite our
              colleagues in tertiary education to join us in our plans for a specific
              exploration.
                So far we have been conducting email games with volunteer groups
              (usually listservs and learning communities) where participants have
              the total
                choice about their participation. We are curious about the impact
              of other instructional contexts on the participation rates and learning
                outcomes. For example, anecdotal data currently suggest positive
              changes
                when email games are incorporated in college courses as a mandated
              requirement. We are planning to explore the optimum integration of
              these games into
        vocational and higher education curricula.</font></p>
