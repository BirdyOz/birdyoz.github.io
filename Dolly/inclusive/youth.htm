    <h1>Youth projects</h1>
    <p class="note">This page links to resources and case studies with young  people in VET, predominantly aged 15 – 19. </p>
    <p>Many young people have a strong facility for technology,  although many of the projects found that by giving technology to students, it  doesn’t mean they are going to use it.   Check out what works on the youth page and visit the online forum for  further ideas and resources. </p>
    <h2>Using Gen Y social networking tools  to engage apprentices in learning</h2>
    <p><strong>North Melbourne Institute of TAFE, VIC</strong><br />
        <strong>Project leader:</strong> Sue Kurt</p>
    <p>In this project reminder SMS messages were sent to Building and Construction  (BC) students about their block training requirements.&nbsp; This proved so  successful that the Manager has approved the use of this system for all BC  departments in 2008.</p>
    <p>Despite successes the project highlighted that young people &quot;do not seem  ready to use their social networking tools as learning tools&quot;, preferring to  use their mobile phone and MySpace for personal use only.</p>
    <h2>Heutagogy - using technology to  create new learning cultures </h2>
    <p><strong>West Coast TAFE,   WA</strong><br />
      <strong>Project leader:</strong> Jackie Pedley </p>
    <p>Gaining Access to Training and Education students were given a range of  technologies to develop podcasts and personal learning environments.</p>
    <p>It became apparent that not all young people are 'technologically savvy' or  have access to, or wish to have access to, all of the Gen Y tools and e-tools,  such as mobile phones and blogs.&nbsp; Nor do young people necessarily have the  digital literacy skills to be left to their own accord to decide what they want  to learn, and how they would like to learn it (ie Heutagogy), even with the  assistance of technology and e-tools.</p>
    <p>Another important discovery by the teaching staff has been that the  collaborative journey has seen &quot;students becoming instructors and instructors  becoming learners from the students. The line between teaching and learning has  blurred and resulted in the most conducive, non-threatening inclusive  environment for both staff and students.&quot;</p>
    <h2>South West Youth Pod Tours</h2>
	    <div class="img-shadow"><img src="images/sw_tafe.jpg" alt="Insert appropriate screencapture here" name="screencapture" width="190" height="190" id="screencapture" style="" /></div>
    <p><strong>South West Institute of TAFE, VIC</strong><br />
    <strong>Project leader:</strong> Julie Bertram</p>
    <p>General Education for Adults Students developed confidence in using technology  (computers, MP3 players/ recorders, Audacity), public speaking skills and what  it takes to work as part of a team, whilst developing local 'pod-tours'.&nbsp;  They have also found a 'relevance' to their learning through project-based  activities.</p>
    <p>&quot;The creation of a local youth focussed pod tour  proved the perfect medium to engage young people back into an educational  setting.&nbsp; It was a fantastic tool for teaching them and getting them  comfortable with using technology that they may not have been familiar  with.&nbsp; The confidence they gained through the use of this technology was  exceptional and it gave them back some reassurance that they can be valuable  community contributors.&quot;</p>
    <h2>Nursing  Pathways for Rural and Remote Youth</h2>
    <div class="img-shadow"><img src="images/tafe_sa.jpg" alt="Insert appropriate screencapture here" name="screencapture" width="190" height="190" id="screencapture" style="" /></div>
    <p><strong>TAFE SA Regional Institute, SA<br />
    </strong><strong>Project leader:</strong> Margaret Granger </p>
    <p>This project showed that isolated Cert III in Aged Care VET in School students continue to show preferences towards traditional distance learning methods (ie written workbooks and one on one) and demonstrate a resistance to ‘risk learning’ in the online environments of Moodle and Centra, highlighting that we can &quot;never assume that Gen Y would prefer to learn by using the new technologies&quot;.
    Discussions with the Project Leaders centred on the need to make the online environment the students’ one-stop shop by making Moodle and Centra the students main way of accessing their learning materials and support.</p>
