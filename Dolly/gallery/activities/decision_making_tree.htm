	<div id="why">
      <h2>Why include decision-making trees?</h2>
      <p>Decision making trees are sometimes referred to as Action mazes. Similar in concept to a 'choose your own adventure' novel, they provide a highly effective structure
within which you can lay out options. Learners can investigate the possible
outcomes of choosing those options. They  help the learner to form a
balanced picture of the risks and outcomes associated with each possible
course of action. </p>
      <p>Students can safely explore the 'cause and effect' nature of a scenario or process. Consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an occupational health and safety scenario</li>
        <li>a simulation of a practical activity that might involve dangerous chemicals or equipment</li>
        <li>a scenario, such as a human relations dispute, that might take weeks to 'play out' in real time. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Decision making trees can also be used to  develop a range of other content for learners:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>as a  narrative tool in ESL and language learning where learners can decide from  choices on how a story might progress (such as the &lsquo;Choose your own adventure&rsquo;  books)</li>
        <li>as a  content exploration tool where learners follow content of interest based on  choices provided to them </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In this way, decison making trees share some overlap with <a href="../content/simulation.htm">simulations</a> and <a href="virtual_lab.htm">virtual labs</a>, described elsewhere in this site. </p>
      <p>Decision-making trees can also be used by learners to map out a process in, for instance, project-based work. For instance, IT students who need to design a new software product could design their own decision tree to map out the project, identify possible problems and design navigation and user interface. </p>
      <p>Consider using Decision Making Trees&nbsp;  in tandem with concept maps to support learner to map out a process,  work flow, cause and effect relationships in project-based and group tasks.</p>

    <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating decision-making trees </h2>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <p>The most challenging step in producing a decision making tree is in the initial design. One of the best ways to design a decision making tree is to use a packet of sticky notes and a piece of butcher's paper or a whiteboard. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Establish the central scenario. Make sure your       scenario is:
          <ul>
            <li><em>Realist:</em>&nbsp; The basic context, characters and        situations should feel like they have come from an authentic case</li>
            <li><em>Relevant:</em> Your learners are more likely to be engaged by a scenario directly        related to they skills and work place context connected to your training        program.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Describe the initial decision point in the decision making tree. This can be done on a sticky note or  through using Concept Mapping software</li>
        <li> Consider the number of alternatives from the initial decision point. It is worth starting small (2 or 3 choices). Decison trees can become quite complex after only a few decision points. For instance 3 decison points each with 3 alternatives, generates <strong>27</strong> possible alternatives. </li>
        <li>Once you have established the decision points, draw lines between them to descibe the pathways through the 'maze'. Some of these lines may link back to earlier decision points.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This design now becomes the basis from which you develop your online resource (see the Technical notes section). </p>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>Usually, decision making trees are used as a formative assessment tool. It would be possible to have the learners develop their own decision trees and use these as the basis of assessment.</p>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <p>Decison making trees can be produced using a number of established technologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>as a series of linked web pages built using web page software</li>
        <li>as a series of linked web pages built using a       Wiki</li>
        <li>in multimedia authoring tools, such as Flash</li>
        <li>using dedicated decision tree software, such as <strong>Quandary </strong>(see below).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>good organisational skills</li>
        <li>the ability to break down complex processes and map them out visually</li>
        <li>basic to intermediate IT skills.</li>

        <li><strong>ARED (Applications for Rapid E-learning Development) <br />
          </strong>ARED is a free  tool to help trainers quickly create interactive activities (including multiple  choice, true and false quiz questions) for online learning and combine these  activities into a learning sequence. These activities can then be integrated  into a blended learning delivery approach or a learning management system (LMS).<br />

            <li>a timer</li>
            <li>scoring mechanisms</li>
            <li>&quot;assets&quot;, such as money in a stockmarket simulation or a piece of equipment in a laboratory simulation. <br />
            These assets can be collected along the way and be used by the learners to help them complete the activity. <a href="http://www.halfbakedsoftware.com/quandary.php" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">http://www.halfbakedsoftware.com/quandary.php</a></li>
