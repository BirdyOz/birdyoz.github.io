      <h1>Learning object repositories</h1>
      <p class="note">A learning object can be a single file such as  an animation, a video clip, a discrete piece of text or URL, or it could be a  collection of contextualised files that make up a learning sequence. Learning objects  are digital resources that can be identified, tracked, referenced, used and  reused for a variety of learning purposes. Learning object repositories enable  users to search for, share, evaluate and download learning objects for later  use and customisation.</p>

    <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include learning object repositories?</h2>
        <p>Learning  objects can be built or downloaded from repositories and depending on their  structure, modified using many different authoring tools. Trainers can use the  same object across a variety of software platforms.</p>
        <p>Learning  objects can be stored and shared in a Learning Management System (such as  Moodle, Blackboard etc) so that other trainers both within and beyond their  training organisation can reuse and modify the original design and content for  their respective learners. </p>
      <p>Learning  Objects can be combined to make courses that can then be customised to suit the  needs of different audiences. Courses can be constructed using components from  a wide range of sources giving Trainers access to a broader range of content  and activities.&nbsp; Components from courses  can be reused to meet a range of learning needs. Time poor Trainers can deploy  and modify learning objects on the fly for fast delivery to their learners.</p>
        <p>Learners can benefit from  courses that have been personalised and constructed to meet individual learning  requirements. Trainers can quickly provide contextualised learning in  digestible chunks that is available on a just in time basis for learners.  Learners can benefit from access to resources developed from a variety of  sources using different instructional design principles. </p>
      <h3>Features        </h3>
        <p>Learning objects come in a vast variety of shapes  and formats. They range in diversity from a chapter in a book, to points and visuals on an  overhead transparency or PowerPoint slide, and can be applied to a range of purposes,  in a range of settings by designers, managers, trainers, content writers and learners.</p>
        <p>There are five characteristics essential to  learning objects within the VET sector.<br />
          Learning Objects should be: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Discoverable<br />
          </strong>In order for a learning object to be usable it  needs to be discoverable. To be discovered, all resources contain (or are  associated with) metadata. Metadata provides a range of information about the  object including a brief description, competency covered, subject, resource  type, publisher and date created.          </li>
          <li><strong>            Interoperable<br />
          </strong>Learning Objects should be capable of being shared  across training organisations and learning and content management systems.  Selecting a range of objects from a repository and combining them into a learning sequence requires  them to be packaged in a standard way that allows them to be used and  &ldquo;unpacked&rdquo; in a range of learning management systems. The Sharable Content  Object Reference Model (SCORM) is an evolving standard that supports this  concept. </li>
          <li><strong>            Context-able<br />
          </strong>Context is very important in terms of providing  authentic learning within the VET sector. Learning resources should therefore  either have an existing level of context (i.e. contextualised) or should be  adaptable to a variety of contexts          </li>
          <li><strong>            Editable<br />
          </strong>An important feature of all learning resources  within the VET sector is that they can be retrieved, saved, edited and used.  Once edited, a learning resource may take on a considerably different  appearance or function. In this case, it may actually be considered a new  resource that can then be reused by others. It may also be then repackaged and  subsequently shared back to the VET sector via a Repository.        </li>
          <li><strong>            Re-usable<br />
          </strong>The ability to be able  to re-use existing objects is also important for the VET sector as it means  greater access to a wide range of resources and less overhead in developing  resources from scratch.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>A repository is a  collection of Learning Objects (or metadata describing Learning Objects) that  is managed by technology that allows users to find, retrieve, publish or submit  them via a network. Because learning objects are in digital formats, they are  deliverable over the internet and therefore accessible by any number of people.</p>
        <p>A Learning Object  Repository has three components: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Storage of  objects (or metadata describing them) &ndash; which is generally a database. </li>
          <li>A search  facility &ndash; which searches the database and locates any resources matching the  user&rsquo;s requirements.</li>
          <li>An interface &ndash; this could be a web page where users can conduct a search  or upload new resources.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> Learning Object  Repositories should:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be simple to  use</li>
          <li>Have effective  search functions that delivered relevant results</li>
          <li>Add value to  Trainers participation &ndash; i.e. save them time or effort or provide support in  acquiring new resources </li>
          <li>Have some  system to regulate the quality of content in the repository.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Learning Objects can incur a charge to be used,  depending on the copyright owner. Toolbox materials produced under Crown  Copyright are free for download and customisation by registered Training  Providers.</p>

        <h2>Integrating Learning Object Repositories</h2>
        <p>Learning  Objects enable access to third party learning material that present content in  new and innovative ways including multimedia presentations, the use of  scenarios, case studies and industry context driven activities.</p>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <p>Identify the learning objects you need  by deciding on the content for a particular competency or group of competencies  that you want to use with your learners. Many of the toolbox materials for  example have been broken up into smaller chunks around units. They use a  variety of learning strategies case studies, scenarios, demonstrations that  work toward the collection of workplace knowledge to undertake assessment  tasks.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Search  a variety of learning object repositories for learning objects that meet your  criteria</li>
          <li>Examine  the learning object content, learning activities and assessment activities.  Evaluate these against their match to your delivery approach and decide if you  need to customise them for your purposes. If so, estimate the time and skills  you may need to customise them to meet your delivery needs.</li>
          <li>Decide  on the most appropriate software package to customise the content. Will you be  able to customise the content yourself or will you need to commission  multimedia developers to make the changes you need?</li>
          <li>Customise  the content and activities if required. Use the links below in the section  'From the Framework' to help you work through the building.</li>
          <li>Test  and evaluate the Learning Object to ensure that it performs correctly in all  situations. </li>
          <li>Publish  the content to the web (website, blog, wiki or to a Learning Management  System), CD-ROM/DVD. Prepare learning activities to support and introduce the  content delivery. </li>
        </ul>
        Trial with a group of  learners to collect feedback to enhance the content and delivery of your  customised learning object.
<h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>Learning Objects contain learning activities and strategies supported by  a variety of learning content that function as underpinning knowledge in an  assessment task. Assessment tools and tasks may form part of the object.  Customisation is likely to be required to embed assessment that meets your  training delivery objectives.</p>
        <h3>Generic skills</h3>
        <p>The development of Learning Object content should involve the learner in  analysing, synthesising and applying new knowledge. It is important to have  additional activities supporting the content delivery, which encourage the  learner to engage with and use the content in a meaningful way. Learning  Objects sourced from repositories are unlikely to meet the requirements of all  your training content for a particular delivery. Consider developing activities  that support the learner to learn about how the learning material is organised  and delivered. </p>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>Learning Objects may contain a variety of interactive and multimedia  content that will require the end user to have plug-ins (Flash, Shockwave,  audio and video) installed on their computers. Increasingly these plug-ins are  standard on computer systems but you need to make sure that your learners are  provided with information on how to download and install any additional  software that is required to make the content presentation work properly.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Using Learning Objects in your training requires a variety  of skills. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Searching<br />
            Learning Objects Repositories work like any other search function on the web.  Trainers can browse for learning objects by browsing topic areas.</li>
          <li>Previewing and downloading<br />
            When you do a search a list of available learning objects linked to your search  terms will appear.</li>
          <li>Previewing the learning object online<br />
            To preview the learning object, select the name of the object. You will still  need to download the object to use for delivery </li>
          <li>Downloading  the learning object </li>
          <li>Accessing  and using the learning object</li>
          <li>Evaluating the learning  object with learners. <br />
            Learning objects need to be evaluated prior to use in  delivery to ensure they met the training objectives you have set for your  training.</li>
