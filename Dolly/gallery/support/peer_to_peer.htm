      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include peer-to-peer collaboration?</h2>
        <p>The opportunities to learn from and with others is often central to teaching and learning programs. One of the advantages of online learning is that it provides many opportunities for learners to work and communicate together. </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>structured private discussion areas </li>
          <li>one to one email collaboration </li>
          <li>small group facilitation in text or voice       chats. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Peer-to-peer collaboration can occur over a variety of tools, most of which are independent  of server software and can be run easily on the learners machine. Peer-to-peer  activities can be conducted using a range of strategies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Peer-to-peer software<br />
          </strong>There are a  variety of software tools that enable<strong> </strong>workgroup collaboration. The  creation of shared spaces, such as those made available by Groove (<a href="http://www.groove.net/">www.groove.net</a>), enables groups to collaborate over space  and time. These P2P network don&rsquo;t not require a central server to locate all  related files and other assets (sound files, videos etc). When a peer (on their  computer) requests a resource, the network supplies the resource from another  peer (on a different computer) that happens to have it.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="../activities/learning_mgt_systems.htm">Learning  management systems</a></strong><br />
          Most Learning management systems enable trainers to develop group spaces within  broader learner groups to enable subsets of learners to share resources, alert  each other to who is online, communicate through discussion forums, voice  boards, on board wikis and to respond to group activities, sharing and problem  solving.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="../activities/wikis.htm">Wikis</a></strong><br />
          A wiki is a collaborative online space where learners can gather to build  content together. Wikis can be available for general public consumption or locked for  group member&rsquo;s access only. Wikis encourage participation and a strong sense of  common purpose thereby developing valuable communication and teamwork skills.  Using wikis supports asynchronous communication allowing learners to contribute  at a time, and from a place that suits them. Wikis can be used to support the dissemination of  information, to enable the exchange of ideas, and to facilitate group  interaction. Further, wikis can be used to create a set of documents that  reflect the shared knowledge of the learning group. Class wikis  include text, pictures, links to other resources and multimedia . </li>
          <li><strong><a href="../activities/instant_messaging.htm">Instant  messaging (IM)</a></strong><em><br />
          IM </em>is a form of online  communication that allows real-time (or close to real-time) interaction through  personal computers or mobile computing devices. Users can exchange messages  privately, similar to e-mail, or join group conversations. While typed text  remains the primary convention for IM, the technology has allows users to send  images, audio and video files, and other attachments to their contacts. Instant  messaging can also be undertaken on mobile phones through SMS messages.</li>
          <li><strong>Voice over Internet Protocol, also called <a href="../activities/voip.htm">VoIP</a></strong> (pronounced <em>voyp</em>) <br />
          VoIP is the routing of voice conversations over the internet or through any other IP-based network. VoiP applications are telephone services that allows users to voice and text chat, share  files, share hyperlinks, and conference call as well as see each other on video  through a web cam.</li>
          <li><strong><a href="../activities/virtual_worlds.htm">Virtual worlds</a> </strong>are  online environments where multiple users can interact together or with  characters or interactive environments. Virtual worlds are immersive 3D  environments where users have a great deal of freedom in terms of where they go  and who the can interact with. Users participate in the world through the control  of an avatar or online persona. An Avatar allows a user to choose how much of their  real self they wish to portray in the virtual world, potentially allowing them  to act as completely different people. </li>
          <li><strong><a href="../activities/social_networking.htm">Social  networking</a></strong> encompasses  a number of tools that can used to develop content and communication in an  interrelated relationship. These tools are generally freely available to  trainers and web users and include blogs, wikis, podcasting, social  bookmarking, virtual conferencing as well as social network sites.</li>
        </ul>
    <a href="peer_to_peer.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a> </div>
      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating peer-to-peer collaboration</h2>
        <p>Although some peer-to-peer  interaction may occur spontaneously you may wish to design delivery to include  opportunities and activities that require collaboration between learners. Many  of the online communication tools provide opportunities for learners to work  together. <br />
Peer-to-peer collaboration,  regardless of the tool used, lends itself to a variety of group activities in  an online setting, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Co-authoring<br />
          </strong>Learners use a web-based tool  to collaboratively generate and edit content. The use of a central location or  online tool means that everyone is contributing to the same space. </li>
          <li><strong>Collaborative problem solving and collaborative research</strong><br />
            Learners work together to develop solutions to problems or  strategies for approaching tasks. Social software tools assist Learners to  communicate with one another easily and regularly, either in a text form or  verbally, to collaborate. </li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge sharing</strong><br />
            Learners develop shared  meanings and understandings by communicating and collaborating on projects,  research or through conversations. Collaboration and group projects enable the  exploration of differences in opinion and to build consensus amongst learners.</li>
          <li><strong>Mentoring<br />
          </strong>Professionals, experts or more  experienced learners can enter the collaboration space sporadically to act as  guides or to provide a broader vocational perspective for learners</li>
          <li><strong>Online peer review</strong> <br />
            Learners can submit their work  or ideas via the Collaboration space; the work is then assessed by other  Learners of a similar level of knowledge in the field and the learners comment  and provides improvement suggestions. Learners may follow a structure process  of peer review that contributes to assessment. </li>
          <li><strong>Resource making</strong> <br />
            Learners can use their social  network to develop learning resources to support future learners in their  subject area. Learners gather or create learning resources, media or web links  and use social software tools for sharing the resources amongst a group or  wider community. Learners can access other online networks for exploring  resource collections assembled by others outside their learner group. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Design collaborative activities and sequence       the steps that need to occur. </li>
             <li>Select the online communication tools that       will best facilitate these interactions. You may choose to pair students       using email communication. Or if you are using a discussion forum you will       usually be able to create private spaces for selected members.       Alternatively online chat rooms can be set up for small groups. </li>
             <li>Provide clear instructions on what is required       of the learner groups, how they should contact each other and how often       they should interact. </li>
             <li>Be explicit to learners about whether their       peer-to-peer work will be monitored and assessed. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>Many activities and assessment  tasks will require learners to work together for a common goal. If their  collaborative work is going to be assessed learners should be clearly informed  of the expectations and assessment criteria. </p>
        <p>Consider the use of  Peer Review to contribute to assessment outcomes. Carefully develop a framework  for peer review or explore the Spark Tool (see in the Resources link below).</p>
        <h3>Generic skills </h3>
        <p>Team work, problem solving and communication are skills that will be required in most workplaces. Increasingly individuals will be asked to exercise these skills in virtual teams using online technologies. The activities they complete collaboratively in online learning will assist in developing these skills. </p>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>You will need skills in setting up online spaces in which learners can meet. </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>You will need skills in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>promoting the benefits of collaborative work</li>
          <li>designing authentic and engaging collaborative tasks</li>
          <li>managing and encouraging the learners in their collaborative efforts</li>
          <li>intervening when collaborative work is not progressing satisfactorily.</li>
