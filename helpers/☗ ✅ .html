            <h3>Select standardised screeners</h3>
            <p>Select <strong>standardised screeners</strong> which you will use to test students upon school entry e.g. the PAT-Maths, NAPLAN. Key areas to target may include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Spelling</li>
                <li>Reading</li>

            <p>Select more <strong>comprehensive standardised tests</strong> you will use if students are shown to be eligible for support in the key areas mentioned. This will answer the questions of:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What are the key areas of concern?</li>
                <li>What are the causative factors?</li>

            <h3>Select formative (baseline &amp; outcome) tests</h3>
            <p>Select <strong>formative (baseline &amp; outcome) tests</strong> (often embedded within intervention programs) which will allow you determine where the student is positioned in a key area on the developmental continuum (that is, their "growth point' or 'zone of proximal development'), and create an evidence based intervention. This will enable you to answer the question: What is the learner ready to learn?</p>

<p>An assessment pathway is a system in which screening and assessment are set up at a school. This diagram explains how this can be done:</p>

<p>Here are two examples of how some schools assess students and make critical assessment decisions:</p>

<p><strong>ACTIVITY: Open the first Assessment Pathway and answer the following questions:</strong></p>
<p>What learning areas are <i>screened for</i> at this school?</p>
<p>Different schools have different <i>cutoff points </i>for students receiving further investigation. What is this school’s cutoff point?</p>
<p>Describe this school’s way of deciding which students require further testing for decoding issues?</p>
<p>What do you think the different colors represent on this pathway?</p>
<p>Do you have a similar system at your school, or is this something you could implement?</p>
