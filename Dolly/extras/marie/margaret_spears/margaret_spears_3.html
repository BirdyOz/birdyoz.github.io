          Found the technology very frustrating. Threaded discussion as I&#8217;ve
                          discussed in another section, but also the chat room. I met Robyn in the
                          chat room on a Saturday. The actual chat was very painful. The screen kept
                          refreshing and I&#8217;d lose my place and have to start again. When I
                          got into the chat room, Robyn didn&#8217;t really seem very interested
                          in talking. She kept fobbing me off which I found very annoying and disconcerting.
                          She&#8217;d gone out of her way to set up a chat on a Saturday but then
                          only wanted to literally spend 10 mins. It may have been the technology,
                          but I was left really wondering what was going on. No adequate explanation
                          was given why she didn&#8217;t really want to chat after she had gone
                    to all the trouble of getting me there.</font></li>

                      forum rather than the staff room, which I found quite disconcerting.</font></li>

          To remember not to give away who I was by giving information that would
                                  put me in context, eg. I think I said in one of the discussions that I
                                  was taking the year 6 kids on an excursion so wouldn&#8217;t be around
                                  much. The only other person I knew in the simulation was working with me
                                  on another project and because of this knew that I was actually going to
                                  Sydney on an excursion with my Diploma 2 students. It obviously wasn&#8217;t
                                  a great leap for her to figure out who I was. I know I almost gave it
                                  away another time by mentioning I was going to Sydney, which would have
                                  told

            versus private persona. This was a very interesting situation. I

            street
                      talk was so big and confronting that I found it took a
            long time to get into it. These people seemed to be so at ease with
            the whole thing, especially
                      Simmo, who I now know was in her fourth simulation and
            found that this worked the best. I was asked at the debrief why I
            didn&#8217;t sign the

          Able to practice strategic questions. This is a personal goal of mine (Margaret
                          not Bernard). I went to this great workshop based on the work of Fran Peavey
                          that demonstrated the use of strategic questions. I&#8217;m trying to use
                          them within my work and personal contexts. (Work seems to be easier than
                          home I have to say). One of the first questions to ask rather than Why
                          don&#8217;t you agree is what concerns you most about this issue. It
                          cuts to the central core of the matter. There are also questions on feeling.
                          It is very similar to these questions but there are 11 different question
                    types in total.</font></li>

          Shows there is not always an easy or obvious solution. This was probably
                            my greatest concern with the whole thing. This money suddenly seemed to
                            be available. I find that in real life, money is often not available. People
                            were happy that the council were going to pay for a wire fence and rose
                            hedge/garden, but the realities are often that people make these promises.
                            I think it was stated that when the money was available. Maybe I&#8217;m
                            a bit of a cynic, but when they say things like this I don&#8217;t think
                            the money ever comes available. This actually was one of the hardest
                            things about the whole thing for me. People were promising money or going
                            to lobby
                      the government, but the realities were that we were all making it up.</font></li>

          Made me aware of people's hidden agendas. I&#8217;m pretty much an open
                              book. What you see is what you get. I tend to say what I think and try
                              to stand up for my beliefs. However I am realising more and more many people
                              do not do this. I have to confess I find this one of the most frustrating
                              things when I&#8217;m dealing with people., especially students. Many people
                              seem unwilling to foster debate and to disagree. As a teacher I really
                              like it when students challenge me. Get me to put my money where my mouth
                              is. I try to do the same to them. If it expands both our understandings
                              of issues then it&#8217;s worthwhile. Many people do not seem to want
                              to look deeper into issues, and want to find the superficial quick answer.

                even be more). The council administrators (being a council run
                centre &#8211; at
                least 3 &#8211; 4 people) the media, parents in the service and
                so on. My biggest concern about the whole thing would be that
                it could
                get out
                of control. I would need to be assured that I was meeting the
                learning outcomes of the modules. Changing attitudes and beliefs
                is very much
                core to what we do, however they are not always evidenced in
        the learning outcomes that we teach. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Getting
            students into a role could help them see the other side of
                  the issue. I wonder if you should actually get people to take
                  a role that is
                totally foreign to them so they can see the other side of it.
            But it if is totally alien, they may be so out of their comfort zone
                  they
                  cannot
                operate in character. When debriefing with the other participants
                  in needle stick, this is one of the issues that came up that
                  people&#8217;s characters
                were very different from their real life persona. Some found
                  it great, others confronting. I think I made Bernard more like
                  the
                  formal side of
                me. I didn&#8217;t like that he was seen as ineffectual so I
                tried to get him to do things that were within the role such
                as talk
                to everyone, but
                found that in actual fact he couldn&#8217;t really do much about
          the whole thing.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You
            would also need to convince the participants that it was a valuable
            learning experience. Like Kate has done,
                  you would
                  definitely need
                  to have some pre-work to get everyone to look at it as more
            than a game. I think
                  the learning outcomes need to be really clear and able to be
                  developed and assessed by all individuals and of course the
            moderator.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Overall
            I found it really valuable. I just wish I had more time to have really
            put into it what I would have like to.
                    I also
                    wish that
                    there had
              been more people involved to form alliances, negotiate etc</font></p>
