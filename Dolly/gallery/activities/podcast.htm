    <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include Podcasting?</h2>
        <p>The  use of audio files by trainers can provide a wide range of applications in the  training environment and augment existing content delivery strategies. Audio files can be  downloaded and played by learners from their computer, on portable mp3 player.</p>
        <p>Podcasts enable learners to engage with content in a  familiar format at times for which access to other online learning content is  difficult (for example, during lunch breaks, travelling to work, while undertaking  domestic duties). </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Podcasting is an internet technology that provides audio files to be  downloaded<br />
automatically to a computer or mobile MP3 device. Without podcasting,  users to go to a web site where the audio files are available and save these to  their computer or listened to them as they streamed (downloaded)&nbsp; into their computer&rsquo;s audio player, such as <em>Windows  Media Player</em>, <em>Real Media </em>or <em>Quicktime</em>.</p>
        <p>With podcasting users <em>subscribe </em>(generally free of charge) to a  podcast, and then as new audio files become available (episodes), they are <em>automatically  downloaded </em>to their computer. These podcasts can then be listened to either  on a computer (without going to the internet) and/or loaded onto our mobile  media, mobile phone/Personal Digital Assistant(PDA)&nbsp; or MP3 player (for example Ipod), and listen  to the podcast anywhere and anytime.</p>
        <p>Podcasting extends the use of audio files by  enabling the learner to subscribe to learning content provided in audio form  through the use of RSS feeds. Audio files can be uploaded to free sites such <a href="http://www.odeo.com/">Odeo</a> and <a href="http://www.podomatic.com/">Podomatic</a> for ease of distribution to users who can then either subscribe to the RSS feed  or listen directly from the site from an embedded media player.</p>
        <p>These feeds can be  subscribed to either in internet browsers (such as Internet Explorer or  Firefox) or podcatching software. RSS feeds can also be used to subscribe to  blogs, wikis, websites with a news delivery function and social bookmarking  sites. Trainers can selectively release podcasts and blog materials to learners  by encouraging learners to use RSS feeds.</p>
        <p>Audio Files can easily be recorded using sound  recording software that enable mixing in of multiple voices, sound effects and  music.</p>
        <h3>Teaching and learning opportunities</h3>
        <p>Audio Files and Podcasts can be used to provide learning content in  training:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>to record face to face sessions or specific summaries of sessions for  absent learners and for learners to review later </li>
          <li>to accompany presentations (e.g. PowerPoint slides) which can be made  available on a blog, along with other support material such as web links </li>
          <li>to provide extra material for self-paced learning </li>
          <li>to share recordings of guest speakers from remote locations </li>
          <li>to provide interviews with subject experts or industry figures </li>
          <li>to provide accessible audio lessons for vision impaired students </li>
          <li>to support learners with literacy and/or other learning difficulties </li>
          <li>to provide content in a variety of languages </li>
          <li>Multi-lingual education </li>
          <li>Foreign language lessons </li>
          <li>To enhance language learning in, for example ESOL (pronunciation  guides), Foreign Language Lessons, or Indigenous languages storytelling and  oral culture </li>
          <li>can be used to show pronunciation of difficult words</li>
          <li>As an instructional training material for trades </li>
          <li>As an assessment tool through Learner created audio files uploaded to a  shared class blog or wiki</li>
          <li>To provide third party content on relevant subject areas (for example <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/rn">Radio National Podcasts</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        As a support to walking tours of workplaces for  training induction or specific instruction.

      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating Podcasts</h2>
        <p>Podcasts can be used for a  variety of purposes including sharing content and an alternative approach to  the submission of assessment material.</p>
        Podcasts can be easily updated and new audio  files can be shared with learners if used in conjunction with a blog that has  an RSS feed.
        <h3>Design steps        </h3>
        <p>Podcasts need to be prepared in accordance  with your training objectives.</p>
        <h3>Planning        </h3>
        <p>While you may not need a script, it is helpful to have an  outline of what you'll be saying.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>10 &ndash; 20 minutes maximum. </li>
          <li>More than one voice better </li>
          <li>Plan material/topic you are going to record (consider what would make an  interesting podcast) </li>
          <li>Consider mixing up the audio presentation through the use of narrative,  question and answer, interviews and guest speakers</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Production        </h3>
        <p>A variety of sound editing software is  available.<strong> <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a> </strong>is  a free, open source, cross-platform audio recording and editing  software is easy to use and is versatile enough for most situations.&nbsp;  Audacity requires you to download the LAME mp3 encoder so you export your audio  files in .mp3 format.</p>
        <h3>Recording  audio</h3>
        <ul>

          <li>Choose a quiet  location where you won't be interrupted. </li>
          <li>While soundcards  on desktop computers&nbsp; allow you to record  voice at a good level, laptops often record at lower levels. You may need to  amplify or normalise the recording</li>
          <li>The built&ndash;in  microphones of many computers, desktop and laptop, generally do not give good  results. Get an external microphone.</li>
          <li>For podcasts with  spoken voice only, the quality does not need to be that high for effective  podcasts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Publishing        </h3>
        <p>Once you've created your first podcast,  you need to prepare it for publishing and post it to the internet. <br />
          You can publish yourself either to a web  host or learning management system.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Save the file in MP3 format. </li>
          <li>Upload the MP3 file to a web host </li>
          <li>Create a link to the  MP3 file in a blog post. </li>
          <li>Creating a special  podcast RSS feed either a) by hand, b) by using a third party service (e.g. <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a>) or c) by using blogging  software that creates podcast feeds automatically (for example <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Podcasting">WordPress</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>You can also publish to  Web-based Podcast Service and Host</h3>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Save the file in MP3 format. </li>
          <li>Select an online podcast service (for example <a href="http://www.odeo.com/">Odeo</a> and <a href="http://www.podomatic.com/">Podomatic</a>)</li>
          <li>Upload the MP3 file and create a blog there</li>
          <li>Share the podcast through an RSS feed or blog       post </li>
          <li>Copy and paste the html code for your podcast       to embed it into a media player on any website </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assessment        </h3>
        <p>If you aim to use Podcasts  in assessment:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep the  required length of podcast submitted to under 3 minutes</li>
          <li>Be clear on  the competencies, generic skills, and performance criteria that need to be  demonstrated.</li>
          <li>Provide clear  guidance on the type of content required in the podcast.</li>
          <li>Give tips on  making the podcast engaging through using a variety of voices, narrative,  question and answers and interviews.</li>
          <li>Consider  opening a class-based account at a podcast service so learners can easily  upload and share their podcasts together. This will enable learners and the  trainer to provide direct feedback.</li>
          <li>Remind  learners that podcasts on podcast services are publicly accessible although  some sites enable private shared areas. Learners do not need logins to view the  material so discretion should be exercised when publishing personal materials  (for example digital stories, workplace case studies etc).</li>
        </ul>
        Encourage the group to subscribe to the group  podcast through an RSS feed
        <h3>Generic skills</h3>
        <p>Podcasts can be used to  share a variety of information and learning materials with a learning group.</p>
        <p>With support, podcasts can be used as an  assessment tool given direction on the form and content of audio file required.  Learners will be developing their written and oral communication skills and  capacity to order their thoughts for a listening audience through the scripting  and production of a podcast. </p>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>An advantage of podcasts is that the recording  and hosting software is free. While you will need to install sound editing  software (for example Audacity) good recording results can be obtained with  very basic knowledge. </p>
        <p>You may need to source and acknowledge the  requirements of copyright for any music or sound effects used in your podcast.</p>
        <p>Files can be exported to pod hosting services  such as Odeo or Podomatic. These have similar functionality to blogs but enable  you to upload your audio file for hosting and subscription through RSS.</p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A basic knowledge and understanding of podcasting  will involve the following:</li>
          <li>File management skills including moving files  from a hard drive to a digital audio player.</li>
          <li>A basic understanding of mixing and editing  audio.</li>
          <li>An understanding of audio file formats including  the correct format for a variety of uses. (WAV and mp3)</li>
          <li>Ability to use headphones/microphones or  headsets.</li>
          <li>If you decide  to have learners develop podcasts for assessment you will need to provide a  high level of support in developing skills in recording, exporting and  uploading.</li>
          <li>Digital audio player or other digital audio  playing device (eg, MP3 player, mobile<br />
            phone, certain car/home stereos, computer, PDA)</li>
          <li>Podcast fetching skills. (either through the use of  internet browsers or pod-catching software) </li>
        </ul>
