    </div>
      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include supplementary resources?</h2>
        <p>Online learners will not have face to face opportunities for clarifying course expectations and requirements. You can provide this support by incorporating a number of supplementary resources into  learning packages. </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Induction materials</strong> can provide support in how to use the online technology.</li>
          <li><strong>Language and numeracy</strong> support tools and activities can supplement course content. </li>
          <li><strong>Study guides</strong> will outline how the various components of the program fit together. Often online learning programs have face-to-face and on-the-job components, hard copy texts, CDs etc. It is important that the learner is clear on how these components relate to each other and when each is accessed. </li>
          <li><strong>Weekly breakdowns</strong> can provide an overview of what is required at each stage.</li>
          <li><strong>Summaries</strong> can indicate  what should have been covered at a particular stage of the learning. These can be sent via email or posted on a discussion board. </li>
          <li><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong> topics in discussion forums can provide  learners with clarification of the requirements of the course. </li>
          <li><strong>Checklists</strong> will allow learners to monitor their progress, keep track of content learnt and activities competed. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="supplementary.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a> </p>
      </div>
      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating supplementary materials </h2>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Anticipate all  the questions that learners are likely to have.</li>
          <li>Prepare a range of support resources in advance and distribute to learners. </li>
          <li>Schedule regular online communication events to clarify any issues that learners have.</li>
          <li>Set up topics in discussion forums. </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>Learners are often anxious about assessment and this can be even more so in an online environment. You should ensure that there are adequate support materials to clearly explain all the assessment tasks. This involves making sure that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> the assessment requirements are clearly laid out within the online course</li>
          <li>learners understand whether assessment tasks will be carried out online or in a face-to-face situation</li>
          <li>online communication forums provide ample opportunities for guidance and feedback on the assessment process</li>
          <li>the learner knows how to  submit online assessment tasks electronically</li>
          <li>the learner is aware of how to get further information. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>The provision of supplementary  resources will involve you in the development of documents using a word  processor, uploading of documents to a website or a learning management system,  the development of weekly timelines using syllabus tools and the management of  an online discussion forum. Many of the information you  need to inform your learners can be developed and shared in an accessible form  using a range of web 2.0 tools including blogs, wikis, podcasts and online  calendars.</p>
        <p>Most Learner  Management Systems include a calendar tool that you can link easily to  assessment and activity due dates as well as posting events such as virtual  tutorials, group work schedules etc.</p>
        <p>An additional useful  tool for sharing schedules with learners is <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=cl&passive=true&nui=1&continue=http://www.google.com/calendar/render&followup=http://www.google.com/calendar/render">Google Calenders</a> but a <a href="http://www.allthingsweb2.com/mtree/CALENDAR_2.0/">variety of calendars are available.</a> </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>Planning and mapping skills to anticipate and manage the range of support resources needed. </p>
