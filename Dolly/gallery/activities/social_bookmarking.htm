      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include Social bookmarking?</h2>
        <p>Online research skills are  critical skills for developing technologically literate life-long learners.  Social bookmarking applications make it easy for individual users to tag their favorite web  pages more easily. These bookmarks can then be easily searched, retrieved and  shared online. Unlike storing addresses in a &quot;favorites&quot; folder on  your computer, tagged pages are stored on the web and are accessible from any  computer. A tagging site also allows you to search among all your stored pages  by keyword, eliminating the need to scroll through dozens of sites and remember  the order in which your links are saved. Tags in social bookmark sites can also  be subscribed to using RSS.</p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy to share  and retrieve web page links</li>
          <li>Encourage data  collection on any computer connected to the internet</li>
          <li>Save  and access <em>personal</em> bookmarks  to electronic resources via a web browser</li>
          <li>Classify/categorise/index  bookmarks with user-defined <em>tags</em></li>
          <li>Share  bookmarks publicly, or with members of a particular group</li>
          <li>Research  - identify other users with similar interests, identify resources tagged  similarly to your resources</li>
          <li>Tags  can be subscribed to by other web users using RSS </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some examples of  social bookmarking tools are <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">del.icio.us,</a> <a href="http://furl.net">FURL</a> and <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">StumbleUpon</a></p>
        <p>These sites  require the user to create a free account. </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>del.icio.us has a useful feature of suggesting       tags as you add a bookmark</li>
          <li>FURL saves a (private) copy of the page, so you       can see the page even if it disappears or changes </li>
          <li>Stumbleupon users can rate sites and get  personalized recommendations according to their interests</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Teaching and learning opportunities</h3>
        <p><strong>Social bookmarking has many educational possibilities:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>collection and provision of websites released to learners through social bookmarking sites that can evolve over the duration of a course/project/training event.</li>
          <li>sharing of learner research or projects.</li>
          <li>collecting Resources, Equipment Manuals, Process resources and  recommendations.</li>
          <li>Listing of books you would like your learners to read.</li>
          <li>establishment of a social bookmarking account for each training group, tag these resources and make the URL available to the class.</li>
          <li> establish specific tag (within a group of tags) that is used to direct individual students to specific readings or resources.</li>
          <li>create a collaborative account could be created, the username and password shared by a class or group of learners who could then tag and share resources.</li>
          <li>support students to learn the use of RSS. Many of bookmarking services also have RSS feeds, so students who use a news aggregator can see new postings automatically.</li>
          <li>groups of learners undertaking collaborative projects share their bookmarks with the trainer subscribed to their rss feed to see the direction of their research. (Some social bookmark tools - for example FURL permit the trainer teacher to review and comment on resources that are bookmarked)</li>
          <li> rate and review bookmarks to help with students decide on usefulness of resources.</li>
          <li>trainers can create a group tag in order to share educational resources on a blog, wiki or social networking site.</li>
          <li>share links to current news items that relate to training discussions.</li>
          <li>examine the popularity of a web site that a learner had listed and examine those who have tagged that resource in order to find new resources. (and perhaps unintended learning opportunities)</li>
          <li>share one social bookmark account between a number of trainers to create and share a broad set of resources.</li>
          <li>learners  bookmark on a subject before (or during) a training session (as a reading exercise), then review those sites after the 'talk and chalk' part of the lesson. </li>
        </ul>

    <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating Social bookmarking</h2>
        <p>Social bookmarking can be  used for multiple purposes. Trainers need to ensure that learners are clear  about the purpose of using them and the intended use. Social bookmarks can be  weaved into quite complex learning activities. To begin using them however  ensure your learners are clear about the purpose in their training underpins  the use of social bookmarks. Social bookmarks allow for regular updating. They  are often best used for sharing resources with learners as well as providing  groups of learners to add to and share bookmarks around specific topics while  web searching.</p>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Plan and design how you will use the collection and sharing of bookmarks in your training program </li>
          <li>Select a social bookmarking tool that you and or your learners will establish an account (for a list of sites, see FEATURES above) </li>
          <li>Establish your account with some initial bookmarks and tags </li>
          <li>Provide an orientation to using social bookmarks with your learners so they are clear how to collect, tag and share the bookmarks you ask them to collect as part of learning activities or assessment tasks you provide. </li>
          <li>Negotiate or define with your learners how social bookmarks will be used. This could include:
            <ul>
              <li>The collection of resources during learning activities </li>
              <li>As part of a web search </li>
              <li>To depict resources collected during a collaborative project</li>
              <li>To rate the quality of information tagged </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Provide learners with clear guidance on the type of bookmarks that should be collected but encourage bookmarks that may be relevant &ndash; though not specific &ndash; to your training program but which promote and encourage incidental learning amongst your learners. </li>
          <li>Provide learners with guidelines as to the content of resources to be bookmarked. Bookmarks and tags will likely be publically accessible. </li>
          <li>Establish an RSS feed from the social bookmark site so you can easily follow the addition of bookmarks by your learners over the duration of the training program </li>
          <li>Embed tags and bookmarks from the site in web content in your learner management system, blog or wiki so they can be accessed from a variety of locations </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>Trainers can use social bookmarking as a tool for  learners to submit resources collected in preparing assessment tasks.</p>
        <p>Social bookmarking activities themselves can be used  as part of the assessment process. Learners will need to know in advance that  the bookmarking task forms part of the assessment and the criteria by which it  will be judged. Support should be provided to the learner to enable them to  effectively use social bookmark tools independently. </p>
      <h3>Generic skills</h3>
        <p>Some of the generic skills and attributes developed  and assessed by social bookmarking are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>effective use  of technology</li>
          <li>planning and organising information</li>
          <li>lifelong  learning</li>
          <li>collaboration and networking </li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>Managing a social  bookmarking account will soon become a basic skill for trainers. Generally the  use of social bookmarking programs is not difficult and requires basic web  searching skills. Trainers will need to have skills in web searching,  researching and classification of information in order to be able to find and  sort the initial information to be shared with learners.</p>
      <h3>Skills        </h3>
        <p>Good  instructional and organizational skills will be required to establish and  support learners through using social bookmarks for learning activities or  assessment. Social bookmarks are likely to require a high level of trainer  support particularly through registering, saving bookmarks, tagging, sharing &ndash;  and for advanced activities &ndash; subscribing to bookmark/tag RSS feeds.</p>
        <p>Tagging could have significant implications for educators, both as a  time-saving strategy and a way to find and share relevant information with  learners more easily. If a user finds someone's list compelling, they  can easily subscribe to it and then be notified when more bookmarks are added  to that list.</p>
