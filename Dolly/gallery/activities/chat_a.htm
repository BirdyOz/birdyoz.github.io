    <ul>
        <li>time for the chat</li>
      <li><a href="../../downloads/webct_chat.pdf">instructions (PDF 17KB)</a> on how to use the WebCT chat tool</li>

  <li>prepared some <a href="chat_prompts.htm" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">prompts</a> which could be copied and pasted within the chat sessions so that she was not hampered by her poor typing</li>
