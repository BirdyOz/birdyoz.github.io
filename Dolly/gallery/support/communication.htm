      <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include teacher mediated communications?</h2>
        <p>Critics of the online learning experience will often cite the alienation of learners as a potential barrier to learning  online. However there are ways to ensure this does not happen. The effective online teacher will be involved in creating a supportive environment for learners. An important aspect of the learning process is the interaction between learners and teachers and between learners and their peers. The added advantage of online communications is that they encourage the learner  to engage in critical thinking, argument, the sharing of ideas, and collaboration. </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Trainers of online courses have  a number of options available to them to facilitate communication between  themselves and learners. These fall into two categories: asynchronous and  synchronous.</p>
        <p><em>Synchronous</em><em><br />
                  </em>e.g.  telephone, chat, video conference, voice chats, virtual classrooms, Voice over  Internet Protocol, Virtual Worlds </p>
        <p>Participants can work online at the same time - real  time </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>can be used by trainers and learners in live       online sessions or in virtual classrooms </li>
          <li>allow immediate feedback, problem solving </li>
          <li>allow interaction between trainers and       learners </li>
          <li>allow for instant clarification or       answering shared questions/issues </li>
          <li>but ... can become chaotic and unstructured. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Asynchronous</em><em><br />
          </em>e.g.  Discussion Forums, email, conference boards, SMS, Instant Messaging, Blogs,  Wikis and Podcasts.</p>
        <p>Participants can work online at different times to one another </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>no need for all participants to be online       simultaneously </li>
          <li>allow learners flexibility to be online when       and where they want </li>
          <li>allow time for reflection </li>
          <li>messages are posted and can be read and       replied to at any time. </li>
        </ul>

      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating teacher communication</h2>
        <p>You are likely to be involved  in extensive online communications using a range of modes. Often these will be  happening simultaneously. <br />
          For example, you may  be</p>
        <ul>
          <li>emailing individuals, </li>
          <li>posting to the group on a discussion forum </li>
          <li>meeting with a small group in a chat using a virtual classroom,</li>
          <li>sending out SMS reminders, </li>
          <li>recording a podcast with assessment information, </li>
          <li>catch up with a learner using Instant messaging </li>
          <li>support a small group project discussion using Voice over Internet  Protocol (VoIP) </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Design steps </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Plan the types of communication events, which       will occur during your course. </li>
          <li>Select one or more appropriate technologies.       These may involve discussion forums, emails, text chats, teleconferences,       voice chats, video conferencing, SMS, Instant Messaging, VOIP</li>
          <li>Spend time on ensuring individuals can       confidently install required software, establish an account, connect any       necessary computer peripherals (for example a headset) and can       independently use the technologies at their home or work location</li>
          <li>Arrange introductory activities or icebreakers       to ensure that learners develop a sense of working in a collaborative       learning environment. </li>
          <li>Set the tone of the online communication by       modelling appropriate discourse, promoting mutual respect between       participants, defusing personal antagonisms, supporting participants who       may be offended and generally keeping the discussion 'in check'. </li>
          <li>Ask lots of questions in order to encourage       interaction between learners. You may, for example, pose the question via       an email or SMS but ask for responses on       the discussion board or in a subsequent voice       chat.</li>
          <li>Ask questions over the range of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy#Cognitive">Bloom's       taxonomy of cognitive questions</a>. Early on you may want pose questions       at the lower level (recall of knowledge) and gradually move onto higher       order (synthesis, analysis, problem solving etc). </li>
          <li>Use the communication technologies to draw       together the issues being dealt with in the learning program. Summarise or       clarify frequently what has been going on. Help learners to understand how       the discussion relates to what has gone before. </li>
          <li>Give regular and encouraging feedback to       posted messages. Send encouraging private messages to people complimenting       them or at least commenting on their entries. </li>
          <li>Set up sub-topics on discussion forums when       needed. </li>
          <li>Provide conclusions to topics and direct       learners to the next stage. Sense and announce when it is time to move on       to a new topic. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>The use of communication activities for assessment has been covered in the Prepare Activities and Assessing Online sections of this website.</p>
        <h3>Generic skills </h3>
        <p>Communicating with learners in  online learning spaces has the potential to develop many of the generic skills.  Skilful trainer mediation will encourage learners to use effective  communication strategies, problem solving and to work collaboratively with  others.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Communicating ideas and information</li>
          <li>Collecting, analysing and organising information</li>
          <li>Using Technology</li>
          <li>Self Management</li>
          <li>Learning to Learn </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>Many of the technologies that  you will use to communicate with learners are reasonably easy to use. Email, SMS and Instant Messaging, for example, is  readily available to most trainers. However, in order to make effective use of  communication tools you need to develop skills in managing the various tools,  setting up the topics, uploading files and archiving discussions. </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>The development of online  moderation or e-moderation skills are crucial in building supportive learning  environment. This will involve developing a range of questioning, negotiation  and feedback techniques. It will also involve being able to move between the  roles of facilitator, administrator, provocateur, pace setter, editor, workplace mentor, promoter, expert and mediator.</p>
