    <div id="why">
        <h2>Why include email?</h2>
      <p>Many teachers will be familiar  with using email for administrative functions with their learners. Email  can be useful for queries, requests for support, or for tutors to follow up on  outstanding matters with individual learners. Email can also be used to conduct a  range of learning activities. In general these activities are easy to construct  and deliver and do not require you or the learners to have access to  sophisticated software and hardware. </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Email was one of the first internet applications  to be developed and is still the most popular and widely used for communication  and transfer information. </p>
        <p>Some email applications <em>(such as </em><em>Outlook,</em><em>Outlook Express</em><em>, </em>Thunderbird<em> and </em><em>Groupwise</em><em>)</em> require a desktop application to be installed and run on the client machine to  send and receive email. Setting up email accounts for learners may be handled  by a central administrator and turn around may be slow. </p>
        <p>The use of free web-mail applications such as <a href="http://au.mail.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Mail</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=mail&passive=true&rm=false&continue=http://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=html&zy=l&ltmpl=default&ltmplcache=2">Gmail</a> and <em><a href="http://www.hotmail.com/">Hotmail</a> </em>is very popular with people on the move or without ongoing  access to a computer. Web Mail can be accessed through any web  browser on any computer that is online. These can be quickly and easily set up  &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; by learners. Many Webmail applications include instant messaging,  online calendars and document sharing tools.</p>
        <p>Email is: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>used extensively around the world, </li>
          <li>is becoming the communication tool of choice       by most businesses and organisations </li>
          <li>allows rapid development of online activities </li>
          <li>can include attachments for learners to use </li>
          <li>allows you, the trainer, to monitor and record       interaction. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Voice Email  software that enables users to send emails using voice rather than text is also  available. Trainers have tended to use voice enabled instant messaging systems  or Voice Over IP (VOIP) tools rather than voice email.</p>
      <p><a href="email.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a> </p>
    </div>
      <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating email </h2>
        <p>Email activities may include brainstorming, polling students, chain writing of stories, correction of work, problem solving, games and much more. </p>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Decide if your activity would be suitable to be conducted via email.</li>
          <li>Plan the steps of the email activity.</li>
          <li>Draft the initial email explaining exactly what learners should do.</li>
          <li>Manage and facilitate the email activity over the agreed period of time.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assessment</h3>
        <p>Most commonly teachers use email as a tool for learners to submit assessment tasks. While this is a possible use, it is by no means as secure as the assessment tools in Learning Management Systems which have built in mechanisms for recording and tracking submission. </p>
        <p>Email activities themselves can be used as part of the assessment process. Learners need to know up front that the email task forms part of the assessment and the criteria by which it will be judged. </p>
        <h3>Generic skills</h3>
        <p>Effective use of email is an extremely important skill in today's world, both for business and social purposes. Within an educational setting learners can develop a number of generic skills as they use emails:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>effective communication (appropriate tone and style of written text)</li>
          <li>self management</li>
          <li>use of technology.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>Management of email is becoming a basic skill for teachers. Generally the use of an email program is not difficult. You will need to have skills in writing and sending emails, attaching files, managing incoming emails into sub-folders. </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>One of the skills that you need  is the ability to manage a large number of emails coming in from learners.  Dealing with this volume of email can be incredibly time consuming as generally  each email needs to be dealt with individually. You may need to develop  strategies for limiting the number of emails that come into your inbox. This  may involve online communications happening primarily via a <a href="discussions.htm">discussion  forum </a>(one-to-many). <br />
You will also need to use  written communication appropriate to email so as to provide a model for  learners. </p>
        <p>Consider establishing  guidelines for learners and email submission so that you are not inundated with  messages.</p>
        <p>Such  guidelines might include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>suggesting that learners contact a co learner or trainer before contacting  you </li>
          <li>requiring email be composed that that the message can be read in a single  screen;</li>
          <li>including an identifying tag (like the course number or key word) in the  subject field to aid filtering like messages into a common folder on receipt</li>
          <li>informing learners when you read your mail and how often you will reply to  shape their expectations about the immediacy of your response. </li>
        </ul>

          It provides a <strong>pre-structured  process </strong>for guiding a group of participants through a series of tasks.  These tasks are designed to progressively generate and process content around a  salient issue.<br />
        A game is played  in several rounds and <strong>participants engage in activities </strong>like  brainstorming, analyzing, evaluating, synthesizing, predicting and persuading  each other.<br />
