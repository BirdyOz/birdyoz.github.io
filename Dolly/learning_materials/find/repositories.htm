      <h1>Using learning object repositories (LORs)</h1>
    </div>
    <p class="note">Searchable collections of learning  objects for download</p>
    <p>Repositories are  banks of digital learning materials which can be accessed via the web. Most  repositories store the material in the form of <strong>learning objects</strong>.</p>
    <p>Some LORs are open for public access while others require  you to become a registered user of the service. They may be restricted to  specific groups, such as staff at a particular organisation.</p>

        An extensive list of web sites that give you access to  learning objects and other web-based learning Resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="using" id="using"></a>Using  learning objects (LOs)</h2>
    <p>More and more learning materials are being made available as  the discrete, stand-alone items called &quot;learning objects&quot;. </p>
    <p>Learning objects are often smaller chunks of learning — for  example, the learning objects in the Toolbox Repository are made by dividing up  (&quot;disaggregating&quot;) the full Toolbox into smaller segments or  activities. But a learning object can be any size and in any format, such as a  single word processor or PDF file, or a more complex combination of web pages,  images, scripts and media files.</p>
    <h3>Sample  learning objects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="http://learningedge.tafe.tas.edu.au/item/487b110c-2705-b0c2-c2e9-aa2c435321d8/fbd902bc-2f48-38de-a528-d0b5726c9386/1/" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">Apply  accident procedures – Hazards</a></strong><br />

        from  the TAFE Virtual Campus Repository, Victoria </li>
      <li><strong><a href="http://tle.tafevc.com.au/toolbox/items/8cede8f0-c9f0-765a-e40e-37c0d99a9b0f/1/ViewItem.jsp" target="_blank" class="external" title="Link opens in a new window">Respond  to security risk situation - Respond to risk</a> </strong><br />
        from the Toolbox Repository</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Packaging  benefits</h3>
    <p>What makes these resources learning objects? They have been  &quot;packaged&quot;  according to agreed  international standards (the most common is SCORM – see next section). This  means:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>everything you need to view and use       the learning object is included</li>
      <li>standardised digital labels       (called metadata) have been included which describe the material       accurately (educational level, source, size etc) using consistentcategories</li>
      <li>all of the resources are zipped       (compressed) together into a single .zip file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is all good news for trainers, teachers, designers,  developers — and learners. The careful packaging of learning objects ensures  that they can be:</p>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>stored compactly in repositories</li>
      <li>reliably located by search engines</li>
      <li>fully previewed online</li>
      <li>easily downloaded</li>
      <li>loaded directly into learning or       content management systems, ready to use</li>
      <li>used on most PCs or systems       without additional software</li>
      <li>edited and customised.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><a name="downloading" id="downloading"></a>Downloading  from a learning object repository </h2>
    <p>One of the strengths of using learning objects in designing  an e-learning course is that you can combine several learning objects from  different sources to meet the needs of your teaching and learning context. </p>
    <p>Once you have found the learning object you need, you can  download it. Depending on the digital rights associated with the learning  object, you will most likely need to agree to the terms of a licence. You may  also need to pay for the learning object before you can download it. Some  repositories require you to register before you can download.</p>
    <h3 class="note">Tip              Don't unzip the file first – your  LMS will do this for you.</h3>
    <p>If the resource is in the form of a zipped package, it is  important that you do not open or unzip the learning object file as you  download it. Simply save it to your computer. Once it has been downloaded you  can either unpack it (unzip the file) or load the zipped learning object  package directly into your learning management system.</p>
    <p>The uploaded SCORM packages will be  unpacked by the LMS, the appropriate navigation and management systems created  and a link to the learning object made available. You can use your LMS’s file  editing facilities to change any content of the files. </p>
    <h2><a name="working" id="working"></a>Working  with SCORM-based learning objects</h2>
    <p>It is becoming more common for learning objects to be  produced as Self Contained Object Reference Model (SCORM) packages.</p>
    <p>SCORM is a set of international standards which describes  how the resources can work when uploaded to a SCORM-compliant learning  management system (see the guide to LMSs in the Gallery of Strategies). </p>
    <h3>Basic editing</h3>
    <p>As well as the learning resource materials, SCORM-based  learning objects also contain .xsd files which describe what is contained in  the learning object and the relationship between these resources. It is  important that these files are not deleted or modified unless you know what you  are doing. </p>
    <p>The learning resource files can be edited, so long as no new  files are added or deleted. To do this you can use one of the appropriate html  or image editing software tools described in <a href="../assemble/index.htm">Assembling learning materials</a>.</p>
    <p>Individual teachers and trainers may have (or quickly  develop) the necessary skills for editing SCORM packages. Others  will continue to need some specialist support.</p>
