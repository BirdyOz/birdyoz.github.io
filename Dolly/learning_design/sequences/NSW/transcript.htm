<h1>Dip. HR Management <span class="style1">(Information Systems)</span></h1>
<p class="note"><strong>Sutherland College of TAFE NSW - Jenni Harding</strong></p>
<h2>The Learners
</h2>
<p>We had 16 learners finishing up the human resource management Diploma at Sutherland College, in the South of Sydney Institute. These people were already attending the college two nignts a week completing four other modules, including one with an externally set exam in June.
  We had had difficulty in getting a teacher for the module, so it had been left until later in the course. Obviously the learners and the teachers didn't really want to come another night to the TAFE, and we also had one person working in London, and one person visiting Bali for three weeks in the middle of the six week module.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Our section, Business Services at Sutherland College had been offering teacher and mainstream training as online and blended options for the previous five years, so we had committed and enthusiastic staff, and people who knew about the incidental benefits of blended learning, as well as more obvious ones.
  For example, the increase in skills for learners relating to information technology, and also the ability of learners to apply those information technology skills to their workplace. A previous learner evaluation pointed out some people did not feel confident in the information technology area, and needed further upskilling within the HR Management Diploma.</p>
<h2>Strategies (Part A)</h2>
<p>To meet some of the challenges in scheduling this particular module, we decided on a blended learning program, and included a face to face induction workshop, handouts, so that people could read on the train, CD-ROM for each learner, virtual communication with forums, chats and announcements.
  We used the Star Industries simulation provided by the HR Management Diploma Toolbox, and we had people apply their learning to their workplaces, and also a lot of collaboration with group work etc.
  Four face to face workshops were planned for the pilot, each for two hours over an eight week period.
  The first workshop was an induction for learners, the second and third focused on content and assessment.
  The forth workshop was an assessment workshop using collaboration within and between small groups, virtual or face to face, depending on what they needed to do.
  The assessment task linked to an evaluation of Human Resource information systems.</p>
<h2>Strategies (Part B)</h2>
<p>Learners have a choice between using their own organisation, or the simulated workplace, Star Industries, available from the HR Diploma Toolbox.
  Only two people in our pilot group chose to relate the task to their own workplace, and found this extremely valuable, not only in the content, but also in networking within their own organisations and in being able to actually find out how their organisations work the balance of power, and how they could advocate for other human resource functions as well.
  Assessment is based on the tasks built into the Toolbox, which the learning activities support.
  Learning is very directed towards supporting learners to complete assessment requirements.
  Learners access the online course within the Janison shell. This allowed announcements, forums, chat and messenger tools to be used for communication. Learners were also given or burnt their own CD of the HR management Diploma Toolbox.</p>
<h2>Workshops</h2>
<p>The first workshop was an induction, so that people were introduced to the platform we were using, the Janison Toolbox, and the worksheets readings from the module, were photocopied and handed out in one group, so the whole course or the reading materials were available as one package, to make it easier for people not yet familiar with using online materials, and to ensure learning could be done in a variety of ways. The induction workshop is scheduled for two hours, and most people in the class were instant messaging each other, and starting the first assessment task by the break at seven o'clock.
  You may have other ideas about why they were so quick.
  The session plan for week one is shown. An expert guest speaker was organised for the next two workshops and he added information as handouts to the forum, as well as discussing the content based on his vast experience with HR information system planning implementation and evaluation.</p>
<h2>Online (Part A)</h2>
<p>The course revolves around a simulated organisation Star Industries.
  An online induction for Star Industries was completed in the induction workshop by all learners, and the Star Intranet was a rich source or resources, not only for this module, but for others being studied in the Diploma as well.
  The course also has task based projects, or one project which is continuing, which can be used as the basis for assessment, and it also has learning objects which support achievement of the learning outcomes, and the completion of the tasks in the project. These include things like an overview, worksheets, web research, audio files and interviews with experts, matching exercises, quizes and various other learning activities.</p>
<h2>Online (Part B)</h2>
<p>Announcements were made each week for information, encouragement and reminders about face to face workshops and due dates for assessments.
  Information from the Toolbox about how to learn was available.
  Learners found the mind map extremely useful, as did the facilitator when starting to prepare for the module.
  Assessment criteria was handed out in an initial handout, as well as available online, to appeal to everybody.</p>
<h2>Collaboration
</h2>
<p>One of the best assessment strategies that we used was a collaborative project-based approach, where learners used the simulation Star Industries from the Flexible Learning Toolbox, and in groups they had to evaluate human resource information systems.
  They could do this in any way they wanted to do, it was entirely up to them. They posted Powerpoint presentations, they were then asked to critique these for the other groups, and to let everybody else know how they thought that their assessments were in relation to the other assessments that they had seen, so some peer evaluation occured, and that was something that was mentioned in the evaluation of the course as well, that they appreciated the collaboration throughout the course, but this assessment task was an excelllent example of that.</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>This has been a great way of learning and teaching at the same time. The Toolbox allowed me to focus on learning and adapting the resources to the learners needs, rather than developing materials from scratch.
  The learning methodology also ensures human resource management Diploma graduates have met the key competencies under-pinning the HR Diploma, so they can use the internet for research and have skills and knowledge in technology that they need to locate further up to date information, within the HR context and within the workplace in particular.
  Probably the best thing about having readings, research reviews, and other learning activities is that you have more time as a teacher for feedback to learners, through emails, forums and chats in particular, and on the phone.
  Learners have been very positive about the methods of learning. Although two comments stand out. First, why couldn't we have done this at the beginning of the Diploma, and the reason for that was because the Toolbox was not available then.
  The second comment: This is fantastic. Are we allowed to look at all of the resources for all the other modules we are doing too?, with a triple question mark.
  It's been one of the few classes where the students are still there half an hour after the finish time.</p>
