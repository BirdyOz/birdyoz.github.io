      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
          2001 I was fortunate enough to experience online education role-play
          with some of the wonderful
          team involved in this Australian presentation.
        The inevitable was looking me in the face, the future of theoretical
        education will be online education, and the most enriching experience
        available to promote that education will be through role-play scenarios.
        It was a fantastic realisation,&#8230; &#8220;the future is here&#8221;.
        </font></p>
      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
          team played out the scenario over the designated period and I had the
          most enriching computer experience to date, that is&#8230; until
          I co-designed, moderated, and played my own role-play scenario, &#8216;Fashion
          House&#8217;, a fashion students&#8217; communications module. Something
          wonderful did happen, we all learnt, and much more than we anticipated.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Intuitions
            are constructed from actions and outcomes, and these are grown from
            when we are babies onwards. The experiences we live provide
          the most enriching learning we can obtain. The role-play scenario provides
          a contained world in which we can experiment with new ideas and social
          behaviour without the permanent outcomes of the real world. My experiences
          in role-play participation were invaluable in enabling me to correct
          and fine-tune my designing of new learning scenarios. What works, what
          slows role-play down, what is too loose or too specific, how to spur
        people into using their imagination, etc. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I
            view the participation in online role-plays as an essential prerequisite
            to understanding how best to construct new role-play learning modules. &#8220;As
            you read a book you learn how the story unfolds, as you write a book
            you guide the reader through levels of understanding&#8221; (but the
            reader will always fill in the picture). By participating in role-plays
            I began to understand that these scenarios are a half-story and the
            remainder unfolds, as the participants exchange their input with each
            other. The designer must relinquish control and respond to the ever-changing
            directions where the participants want to take your story, and why
          not, it is their learning.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;From a solar flare to total eclipse&#8221;, is how I would
          best describe my status. The initial experiences and learning curve
          for my introduction to role-plays was exponential and grand. The discovery
          of this wonderful tool to enrich learners and help make the subject
          their own personal subject was clear and bold. The uptake of a completely
          new understanding of the classroom, with its notion of &#8216;learning
          can be fun&#8217; and the idea that you can log in and out of the classroom,
          was too much head spin for established colleagues to take up. Like
          a classic episode of the <em>Bold and the Beautiful</em> just when things look
          their brightest and best some undercurrent prevents the beauty from
          truly blossoming. In my case, like many others, the notion of something
          so new was too confronting for the status quo. People would have to
          learn another new thing, people would have to put in effort, people
          would have to begin to understand learning in a new way. All of a sudden
          everybody was too busy, &#8220;but hey, it sure looks great&#8221;.
          It was a case of &#8216;where two worlds collide&#8217; but should
          be &#8216;where two worlds meet&#8217;. To be fair it should also be
          understood that the infrastructure for fully developing and engaging
          in the online role-plays was not up to the task. It also occurred to
          me that the time needed to participate in the role-play module &#8216;Fashion
          House&#8217; was far greater that the time required for the communications
          text module it would replace. So there you have it, more learning and
          understanding. Currently I continue to develop scenarios and guidelines
          but I still must wait for my opportunity to implement them into the
        student environment.</font></p>
