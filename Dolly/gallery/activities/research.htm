      <div id="why">
      <h2>Why include online research projects?</h2>
      <p>Online research skills are critical skills for developing technologically literate life-long learners. The goal for learners is to make a decision or solve a problem relating to the question posed.


 The most important work is done by the learner not the teacher.


 Teachers act as facilitators of learning, continuously guiding, monitoring and evaluating.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Research projects often begin with a central or essential question based on an authentic  situation that learners may encounter.&nbsp;The questions are often based around why, how and which is best?</li>
        <li>Research projects
            develop learners' skills in questioning, planning, gathering, sorting and sifting, synthesizing, evaluating and reporting. </li>
        <li>Learners are required to access and organise


 multiple reliable sources (digital, human, print).</li>
        <li>Research projects ecourage  data collection, synthesis, and analysis.</li>
      </ul>      <a href="research.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a> </div>
      <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating online research projects </h2>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Define and &quot;map out&quot; the dimensions       of the question being explored. You can use online technologies with your       learners to brainstorm sub-questions and links. (See the guide on mind       mapping for further ideas). </li>
           <li>The learners (either individually or in teams)       plan the best ways to find pertinent and reliable information that will       help them to construct answers to these questions. Establish guidelines       for teamwork. </li>
           <li>Direct learners to information specialists in       libraries to assist them locate the best information. </li>
           <li>Support learners to use social bookmaking       tools to organise and collect the online sources they have researched.</li>
           <li>Plan strategies for targeting and then storing       the most relevant information. </li>
           <li>Organise meetings (online) to encourage more       systematic scanning and organizing of data. </li>
           <li>Focus on activities, which will encourage       synthesis. Learners may need guidance in arranging and rearranging the       information so that patterns and solutions emerge. </li>
           <li>Arrange online evaluation sessions where       learners can determine if more research is required. </li>
           <li>Provide an online       presentation area where learners (individually or in groups) can report on       and showcase their findings. There are a number of online options for       learners to upload and share their research findings and activities. These can include the use of a       personal blog, group wiki, a podcast, journal, videocast, PowerPoint       presentation etc.</li>
           <li>Plan to include adequate scaffolding to       organize and support the investigation or inquiry and to ensure that       learners do not lose their way. </li>
           <li>Develop and publish a range of resources that       learners may use to progress through the project (templates, flowcharts,       rubrics, websites, evaluation sheet). </li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>The advantage of online research work is that it provides multiple  opportunities to assess learning and application. You may need to develop assessment tools such as rubrics for the various stages of the research project (the process, presentation of findings, research, teamwork).</p>
      <p>Rubrics help make your expectations clear to leaners and help you assess a variety of qualities and behaviors by clearly defining or describing the levels of skill involved.</p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Generic skills</h3>
      <p>Online research  activities provide excellent vehicles for the development of many of the generic skills.  Assessment may explicitly assess some of these skills. Some of the generic skills and attributes developed and assessed by online research projects are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>problem solving </li>
        <li>critical thinking</li>
        <li>initiative and enterprise </li>
        <li>communication </li>
        <li>planning and organising information </li>
        <li>lifelong learning.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <p>You will need to set up and  manage a number of <strong>technologies</strong> such as: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li><strong>communication technologies </strong>to facilitate collaboration and       meetings between team members and teachers (email, discussion boards and       chat) </li>
        <li><strong>web site or Learning Management System</strong> in which to present the research       steps and links to resources </li>
        <li>an <strong>online       space </strong>for presenting research output and findings.       Learning Management Systems such as Moodle,       Janisons,&nbsp; Blackboard etc provide       areas for learners to upload presentations. A wide range of social       networking tools enable options for learners to upload and share their       research findings with co learners and the wider web community. (<em>see       the Related Strategies below</em>).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>Framing the research question is critical to the success of the research project. You will also need skills in facilitation rather than upfront teaching. Your role as a teacher will be very much that of guiding the process using a range of online technologies to encourage and enthuse learnes and to comment on their research output. </p>
