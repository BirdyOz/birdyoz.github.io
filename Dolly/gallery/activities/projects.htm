      <h2>Why include  projects?</h2>
      <p>Projects can be either <strong>individual</strong> or designed for students to work in <strong>groups</strong>. </p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Often learners choose their own topic as well as the nature and extent of content of the project. In a work-based situation the project reflect real life issues.</li>
        <li>Project-based learning typically begins with an end product or &quot;artifact&quot; in mind, the production of which requires specific content knowledge or skills and typically raises one or more problems which students must solve. </li>
        <li>Projects vary widely in scope and time frame, and end products vary widely in level of technology used and sophistication. </li>
        <li> May include <strong>jigsaw</strong> learning. Learners working in groups are given a specific piece of a problem to work on. They become experts in that part of the problem. Other  groups are working on other parts of the puzzle and becoming experts themselves. Finally groups collaborate to provide a 'total view and solution'.</li>
        <li>Ideally projects should be  authentic, mirroring real world production activities.</li>
        <li>The teacher acts as a facilitator, designing activities and providing resources and advice to students as they pursue their investigations. This facilitation takes place within the online environment using communication tools such as email, chat and discussion.</li>
      </ul>      <a href="projects.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a> </div>
      <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating project-based learning </h2>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The Trainer and the learner pose an essential       question that will form the basis of the project. This may be done in an       online learning platform. The question will pose a       problem or a situation the learner can engage with, knowing that there is       no one answer or solution.</li>
           <li>The Trainer develops a plan for the project,       often in consultation with the learner(s). This will often involve the       development of a timeline for completion of the various stages of the       project. This will place learners firmly in control of managing their own       and group time. Negotiate the learning outcomes in       terms of competencies if you are using the Project as an assessment task.</li>
           <li>Learners define the purpose for creating the       end product and identify their audience. </li>
           <li>Learners research their topic and design their       product. </li>
           <li>During the project learners resolve problems       and issues that arise. </li>
           <li>Throughout the project the Trainer manages and       monitors the progress, guiding the learning experience. Support the       learners to successfully completing their project:
             <ul>
               <li>Set benchmarks. </li>
               <li>Time Management </li>
               <li>Model how to schedule their tasks. </li>
               <li>Progressively remind learners of the timeline. </li>
               <li>Help learners set and make deadlines. </li>
               <li>Support diversions by learners but bring central focus quickly back  to project focus</li>
               <li>Renegotiate projects with specific learners if necessary  that ensure they meet with success. </li>
             </ul>
           </li>

        <li>Learners may use or present the product they       have created. </li>
        <li>Finally learners are asked to reflect on and       evaluate their work:
          <ul>
            <li>Share feelings and experiences. </li>
            <li>Discuss what worked well. </li>
            <li>Discuss what needs change. </li>
            <li>Share ideas that will lead to new questions and  new projects. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        </ol>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>The advantage of project work is that it allows for assessment to occur at  multiple points throughout the life of the project. Also there is the opportunity to  assess learning and achievement from multiple perspectives (self assessment, peers, formal assessors).</p>
      <p>The teacher  may need to devise assessment tools such as rubrics for the various stages of the project (the process, presentation of findings, research, teamwork).</p>
      <p>Rubrics help make your expectations clear to students.&nbsp; They help the teacher assess a variety of qualities and behaviors by clearly defining or describing the levels of skill from high to low. </p>

        </ul>
        <h3>Generic skills</h3>
      <p>Online project work  provides excellent vehicles for the development of many of the generic skills. The assessment may even explicitly assess some of these skills. Some of the generic skills and attributes developed and assessed by online projects are as follows: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>problem solving </li>
        <li>critical thinking</li>
        <li>initiative and enterprise </li>
        <li>communication </li>
        <li>planning and organising information </li>
        <li>lifelong learning.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <p>The learners will need access to a range of technologies to conduct their projects and complete their final product. The teacher may need to consider the following technologies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>communication technologies</strong> such as <a href="email.htm">email</a>, <a href="discussions.htm">discussion</a> boards and <a href="chat.htm">chat</a> to meet with teachers and other team members</li>
        <li><strong>web site or Learning Management system</strong> in which to present the project related documents and links to resources </li>
        <li>an <strong>online space for presenting project outputs</strong>. Systems such as WebCT and Blackboard provide areas for learners to upload <a href="presentations.htm">presentations</a>. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
    <p>The teacher will also have to develop skills in facilitation rather than upfront teaching. The teacher's role will be very much that of guiding the process using a range of online technologies to encourage, enthuse and comment on the learner's projects.</p>
    <p>Develop mentor skills to support and model research and project  development abilities with your learners.</p>
