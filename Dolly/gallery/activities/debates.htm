        <h2>Why include debates?</h2>
      <p>Debating activities engage learners in using a combination of skills and strategies. During the preparation for a debate learners research the  facts of a situation and anticipate implications and issues. Learners have to  think critically and strategically about both their own and their opponent's position. </p>
      <p>Students who participate in  debates have an opportunity to explore, listen, and enjoy learning. Debates  give students additional opportunities to hear their classmates' views and to  express opinions regarding topics that matter to them. They also help students  make important decisions and become critical listeners. </p>
      <p>More information about  informal debate method is here- <a href="http://www.saskdebate.com/pdf/resources/classroom/Introduction%20to%20Debate.pdf" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.saskdebate.com/pdf/resources/classroom/Introduction%20to%20Debate.pdf</a></p>
      <p>Internet debates can be conducted that  allow learners to engage in short debates using instant messaging software,  voice boards, discussion forums and virtual classrooms. Learners can then  participate in line with other demands on their time, either synchronously or  asynchronously.</p>
      <p>Internet debate can help learners: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>practice and prepare for training room based face to face debates</li>
        <li>develop a broad and diverse knowledge base </li>
        <li>improve argumentative abilities </li>
        <li>debate with a wider variety of learners, guest speakers and industry experts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Learn more about the wide variety of debate  formats at <a href="http://www.idebate.org/teaching/debate_formats.php" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.idebate.org/teaching/debate_formats.php</a></p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>the debating process is


 adjudicated and a winner is declared</li>
        <li> competitive aspects encourage engagement and a commitment to a position</li>
        <li>encourages the learner to see arguments from various positions </li>
        <li>learners need to  engage in research to develop their position.</li>

    <div id="integrating">
        <h2>Integrating debates </h2>
        <h3>Design steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Identify an appropriate topic for the debate.</li>
          <li> Outline the procedural rules  for the debate.</li>
          <li>Develop a rubric for the evaluation of the debate. </li>
          <li>Pre-teach  debating techniques so that learners know how to proceed. </li>
          <li>Decide on the technology which will be used to conduct the technology (see Technical notes section below).</li>
          <li>Set up private and public spaces in your discussion tool.</li>
          <li>Allocate a time for learners to work together in teams to prepare their argument.</li>
          <li>Run the actual debate and monitor learner involvement.</li>
          <li>Debrief the debate and announce winners.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assessment        </h3>
        <p> Online debates may be used as either formative or summative activities in a course of study. Some of the criteria that can be assessed are :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>evidence of effective research strategies </li>
        <li> understanding of debating procedures and etiquette </li>
        <li>demonstration of critical thinking and problem solving </li>
        <li>delivery of the debate in an effective and convincing manner.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Debates also provide an opportunity for peer involvement in evaluation. </p>
      <p>You may wish to develop a rubric to guide the assessment process. We have prepared a Word document as an example of a document that could be given to learners prior to the commencement of a course outlining the assessment criteria for the debate activity. You may wish to modify it for your own purposes and context. </p>
      <p><a href="../../assessing/downloads/C2_assessing_discussions.doc" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">Discussion activity assessment rubric</a> (Word 44KB) </p>
      <p>Additional debate assessment rubrics can be found here - <a href="http://www.educationworld.com/a_lesson/lesson/lesson304b.shtml" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.educationworld.com/a_lesson/lesson/lesson304b.shtml</a></p>
      <p>Most discussion forum technologies allow you to create a compiled list of an individual's contributions which can be used in assessment. </p>
      <h3>Generic skills</h3>
      <p>Participation in online debates offer extremely rich opportunities for learners to develop  generic skills such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>working in pairs or <strong>teams</strong> in private threads (defining the roles in the team, planning the research for the debate, giving feedback to other team members)</li>
          <li><strong>problem solving</strong> and offering solutions to issues posed in the debate (developing creative and innovative solutions, applying a range of strategies to solve problems)</li>
          <li><strong>communication skills</strong> (writing which is appropriate to the audience, persuading effectively, sharing information, asking for clarification, agreeing and disagreeing)</li>
          <li>effective use of <strong>technology</strong>. </li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>Debates can be conducted in a number of different software platforms.You can use the following tools to conduct a debate in <em>real time  (synchronously)</em>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>virtual  classrooms, mediated by the trainer or another learner</li>
        <li>instant  messaging system</li>
      </ul>
      <p>or to  conduct the debate <em>asynchronously</em>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>discussion  board</li>
        <li>email</li>
        <li>voice  board</li>
        <li>podcast.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These tools  can be stand-alone or form part of the tools in a learning management system  (LMS) such as Moodle, Janison or Blackboard. Using a LMS allows you to use some  of the other functions such as: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> The ability to upload information and websites for the debating teams to use. These can be selectively released to each team . </li>
        <li>Setting up private discussion groups which allows debating teams to work together in private groups where they can prepare the arguments for their online debate. </li>
        <li>Conducting the actual debate in a space which is open to all the participants.</li>
        <li>Compiling  messages posted to the debate in order to facilitate the assessment process. </li>
        <li>Posting archives or recordings of whole debates, contributions or       peer feedback</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Using debates is a flexible strategy that relies on communication  and interaction. They lend themselves to the use of synchronous <a href="chat.htm">chat</a> rooms or in virtual classrooms that use <a href="voip.htm">voice</a> and whiteboards, and by using instant  messaging systems.</p>
      <h3>Skills      </h3>
      <p>You will need to plan and design the debate carefully to ensure that it runs smoothly. When learners are preparing and then running the debate you will need to follow proceedings, and support and intervene when necessary.</p>
