<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p><strong>The  learners</strong><br />
  Providing  quality, industry-recognised training to a geographically diverse workforce is  a common problem for many Australian industries and businesses.&nbsp; Engaging workers in training is quite  another. </p>
<p>In a staff  survey in early 2004 we found that our field operational staff have felt  disadvantaged at working alongside trades qualified people, and having no  opportunity to obtain a relevant National qualification themselves. So we  wanted to offer them the opportunity to enroll in appropriate accredited training.</p>
<p>Our  existing workers have a vast range of working knowledge of our industry and  have embraced the opportunity to have their competencies formally  recognised.&nbsp; <br />
  New  staff also see the career advantage of achieving a formal qualification at the  outset.</p>
<p><strong>The  e-Learning solution</strong><br />
  A primary motivator in SunWater&rsquo;s decision to use  e-learning for its training was the high cost of transporting learners from all over Queensland and  interstate to a classroom setting to cover a total of around 40 different competency  units relevant to the bulk water service delivery function</p>
<p>SunWater  employees are spread from Bamaga (Far North QLD) to Scrivener Dam (ACT).&nbsp;  Getting everyone back for 'block training' meant time out of already busy  schedules, coordination of flights, and completing the courseware using mail  delivered distance material, then waiting for Trainer Assessors to become  available to sign off competencies. Online training seemed to be getting more  attractive by the minute.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>The  course</strong></p>
<p>It was  important to get the right course for our target group. We completed a training  needs analysis and then started to sieve through National Training Packages to  determine what pathway would best fit our business and industry needs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Most of our  staff work in remote sites, so recognition in having the skills and knowledge  to make decisions about a variety of unknown problems was important.</p>
<p>The training focuses on core units of competency to  recognise existing competency within the nationally endorsed Water Industry  Training Package.&nbsp; This means field  workers can be formally recognised for their existing skills and can move on to  further certificate level training. </p>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p><strong>Setting  up a partnership</strong><br />
  One of the keys to starting out in a blended learning  approach is to build a relationship with an RTO (registered training  organisation) that understands the benefits of e-learning and has a commitment  to taking e-learning to industry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our field  staff have, through the change management of implementing all these systems,  become pretty familiar with computer technology, and almost all sites are  linked to the internet or WAN. We researched training providers with industry  experience and an online passion who may be willing to partner with us.&nbsp;  Finding the right training partner to get us up and running with e-learning was  critical. Wide Bay TAFE were instrumental in getting us through this project.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blended  learning approach</strong></p>
<p>The course  is delivered online using Wide Bay TAFE&rsquo;s learning management system &ndash; Janison.</p>
<p>We put in a  lot of effort to get the online content right. All material is contextualised  to SunWater&rsquo;s business processes, right down to the detail of the web page  matching our media style guide.&nbsp; When we  log onto Wide Bay's Janison site, we appear to be  working in a SunWater environment.&nbsp; Staff  can learn when they want to, during whatever shift they work, or even after  hours as the Wide   Bay site is off our  firewalls.</p>
<p>Modules in the e-learning packages include self-paced  activities and formative tests to both reinforce learning and allow workers to  gauge their understanding of the content. </p>
<p>There is  plenty to keep the student involved in learning; we have quizzes, web-links,  and interactive mouse activities.</p>
<p>The learning and assessment material is available  online, and for those remote field workers without access to the web, it is  also available on CD-ROM. All underpinning knowledge will be delivered by  e-learning, with some classroom training provided for elective units requiring  face-to-face demonstration and practice.</p>
<p><strong>Customising  e-learning resources</strong><br />
  The e-learning is based on an existing Victorian  CD-ROM for the water industry that had been developed with a focus on water  treatment. By using much of the structure of the existing product, SunWater was  able to focus on the development of content and assessment material that not  only met Sunwater&rsquo;s business needs but also met AQTF standards.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The material can be easily adapted by other bulk  water service providers, with the only changes required in most instances  relating to organisation-specific policies, procedures and in a few areas,  particular types of equipment or technology used. </p>
<h2>Support</h2>
<p>We knew that  content by itself wouldn't do the trick. We have developed a strong mentoring  structure built around regional workloads and individual learning styles.&nbsp; Using Wide Bay TAFE&rsquo;s Learning Management  System (Janison) we are able to keep in regular touch through online forums and  chat sessions using the communication tools on Janison. </p>
<p>We also find that it is important to encourage our  learners with regular follow up and support by our training co-ordinator  through email, telephone, regional site visits and  newsletters. We encourage workers from different locations to  chat on-line between themselves and share their learning experiences.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Having industry assessors and supervisors who have  also taken on the role of mentor for their staff is an important part of  building pride and ownership of the program within SunWater&rsquo;.</p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>Assessment is both online and through industry  assessors and supervisors, who observe competency during practise.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&lsquo;We have staff at over 40 sites all over Queensland. By allowing  field workers to complete many of their assessments online and directly relate  the learning with the doing has resulted in greater engagement. </p>
<p>We have  adopted a minimum 3 assessment approach; one is an observation checklist signed  off by a supervisor with years of industry experience; another is evidence  where the student completes existing workflow documents and references the  correct Standards and Policies; and another uses written explanations proving  their knowledge given a case scenario.&nbsp;  This also forms a pathway for RPL (recognition of prior learning), so  using this strategy our experienced staff can &lsquo;fast-track&rsquo; through the program.</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>This is our  first foray into online learning, and we offered it to our staff on a voluntary  basis only.&nbsp; Most of them are over 45,  and all are male field workers.&nbsp; We had  an overwhelming response with 80% of the target group wanting to be  involved.&nbsp; Of the first intake of 26  students, we have had one drop out during this first phase of learning, and a  waiting list has been created for future intakes.&nbsp; The more experienced staff have elected not  to fast track their qualification as they are enjoying the online activities  and discovering that e-learning is not daunting after all. </p>
<p>The interest in the new training was solid evidence  that the use of technology in learning need not be a barrier to a totally male  workforce, which includes many mature-aged workers.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Tips</strong><br />
  The technology has been more of a factor in the  engagement than a barrier. And making the activities in the e-learning  completely relevant to their jobs, with assessments integrated into their daily  work activities, further increases the engagement.</p>
<p>We did need to provide some additional support and  coaching to the few learners who were unfamiliar with using computers to help  them navigate through the material, but have been pleasantly surprised that  this has not dimmed their enthusiasm.</p>
<p>For others  in industry, I suggest talk to your Industry Skills Council and peer  businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Find out what worked in the  past and then see if it might be different now.&nbsp;  Don&rsquo;t be disheartened; join positive networks.&nbsp; Be clear in what your end goal is and make  the technology work for you.</p>
<p>Finding  content is always an issue. Toolboxes are great starting points &ndash; there are  many existing resources that someone can develop without expensive consultants  and specialists.&nbsp; Be open to new ideas  and look at old processes with fresh, online eyes.&nbsp; Adult learners are great &lsquo;doers&rsquo; so many  activities keeps their interest and they are often tricked into learning  something!</p>
<p>&lsquo;It makes sense in particular to deliver underpinning  knowledge via e-learning. You don&rsquo;t have to incorporate fancy animation or  sound in the e-learning material, just make sure you are producing a product  based on adult learning principles and incorporate activities that will inspire  the learner&rsquo;,</p>
