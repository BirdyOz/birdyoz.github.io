        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I
              hate role-play in a f2f situation. I don&#8217;t think that people
              give realistic responses and find that basically people tell me
              (or who ever)
              what they want to hear. Either that or they are so over obnoxious
              that they are over the top. But saying that, I really enjoyed this
              activity.
              I think because it wasn&#8217;t face to face so to speak and you
              had logged in as Chris learner, it felt more real. I still wonder
              though
              if I would
        have said those things and if Chris would have responded that way.</font></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I
                found that it was a great activity overall. I liked being asked
              to apply my knowledge and actually get some feedback on it. I
                    was disappointed
                    that
                    many of the others didn&#8217;t go back in and respond to
                    their posts. I find it interesting to see how different people
                    handle
                    student issues.
                    Considering I&#8217;m not a great encourager of role-play
                    in the classroom, this is definitely a strategy I would use
                    when
            developing learning materials.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I
              was forced to respond to a student (oops learner) in a very public
              way that
                needed to be accountable and appropriate.
                          It
                          also gave me
                          the opportunity
                          to practice some of my reflective listening skills
            and help a learner come to a win- win situation in a safe
              environment. I
                          want it to continue
                          now
                          though. I want to know if I managed to get Chris to
            change her way of doing things or will she just slip back into
                          the
                old pattern.</font></p>
