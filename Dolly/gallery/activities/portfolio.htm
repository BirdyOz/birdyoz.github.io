    <h1>E-portfolios</h1>
    <p class="note"> Collections of work (files,  graphics, photos, curriculum vitas, multimedia etc) used to demonstrate  competence that grows with the learner through a lifelong cycle of training and  employment. The purpose of most e-portfolios is to  provide learners with a space to record, reflect and present information about  themselves and their education and training experiences for the purposes of  learning, assessment, and making transitions, particularly to employment.</p>

      <div id="why">
      <h2>Why include e-portfolios?</h2>
      <p>Electronic portfolios can be  valuable activity when teaching online. They give the trainer evidence of a  wide range of skills and achievements and can show development of a learner's  knowledge and or skills over a period of time and engagement in collaborative  learning activities.<br />
Electronic portfolios support a  range of learning processes: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>recording       and storing textual, audio and visual evidence and resources for learning </li>
        <li>active learning with learners setting their       own goals </li>
        <li>collaboration       with others </li>
        <li>motivating learners to produce work to a       standard so that it can be displayed to others </li>
        <li>encouraging a regular system of feedback so       learner</li>
        <li>reflection       on particular items or on a bank of evidence created over time </li>
        <li>communicating       learning outcomes and personal identities to a range of audiences </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Electronic  Portfolios act as &ldquo;a personal learning environment&rdquo; that provides a framework  to organise a learners training and work experiences, achievements as well as a  range of life-based learning events.</p>
      <h3>Features</h3>
      <p>Typically online portfolios may  include: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>evidence of achievement </li>
        <li>details of learner goals </li>
        <li>daily notes on learning progress </li>
        <li>peer evaluations of work </li>
        <li>journal entries which demonstrate a learner's       engagement and reflection with the learning </li>
        <li>feedback from trainers, workplace assessors,       colleagues, employers etc </li>
        <li>major assessment tasks </li>
        <li>reports at the end of the process which       demonstrate synthesis and analysis of the research and the practical       activities. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is a range of software  tools and options for trainers to develop Portfolios with their learners. </p>
      <p>Portfolios can be developed using:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>An Enterprise Led Implementation</strong><br />
          Learning Institution provided spaces that serve as a &ldquo;catch all&rdquo; space for  learner profiles to provides evidence of achievements, skills sets, work  histories and competencies achieved. <br />
          Examples include the <a href="http://eport.tafevc.com.au/">TafeVC ePortfolio</a> in Victoria and the <a href="http://www.studenteportfolio.qut.edu.au/">QUT Student e-Portfolio</a>.  QUT&nbsp; have collected <a href="http://www.studenteportfolio.qut.edu.au/projectinfo/perspectives.jsp">a variety of perspectives</a> on how these portfolios  have been deployed by learners and trainers. </li>
        <li><strong>Blogs</strong> and <strong>Wikis</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Social Network Tools </strong>such as <a href="http://elgg.net/">Ellg</a> </li>
        <li><strong>Open Source Content Management Systems</strong><br />
          A content management system, or CMS, is a web application designed to make it  easy for non-technical users to add, edit and, well, manage a website. <br />
          Examples of CMS include <a href="http://www.mamboserver.com/">Mambo</a> and <a href="http://www.joomla.com/">Joolma</a> . Some CMS including <a href="http://new.osportfolio.org/">OSP</a>, <a href="http://plone.org/">Plone</a>, and <a href="http://drupal.org/">Dupal</a> have been adapted to use as ePortfolio systems. </li>
        <li><strong>Google &ndash; </strong>see the Sample section for an <a href="http://electronicportfolios.org/google/">example</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Regardless of the tool you use to develop e-portfolios, it should enable your learners to  easily:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>input or upload</strong> their content </li>
        <li><strong>organise</strong> their content in folders/labels or tags </li>
        <li><strong>retrieve and edit over time</strong> their content and files</li>
        <li><strong>display their content</strong> either privately by  invitation or publicly through a url (website address).</li>
      </ul>

        <div id="integrating">
      <h2>Integrating E-portfolios</h2>
      <h3>Design steps</h3>
      <p>As you develop the concept of  using electronic portfolios you may like to consider some of the following  design issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider  your learners' abilities in using technology for the development and uploading  of a portfolio. </li>
        <li>The curriculum has  been designed to require learners to use the portfolio in completing their  course work and assignments </li>
        <li>Consider  the technology (software and platforms)needed for uploading learner work.  Several online portfolio tools are available as a means of supporting learners  to easily prepare and upload meaningful portfolios. They also provide  monitoring mechanisms for staff involved in the assessment of portfolios. </li>
        <li>Provide  guidance to learners on the type of work that should be included in the  portfolio. </li>
        <li>Provide  guidance on how the portfolio should be organised, including requirements for  tables of content, dating of work, reflection on the  process and final product. </li>
        <li>Support a process that enables the learner to take ongoing  responsibility for growing their eportfolio into a sustainable demonstration of  their learning and skills. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Assessment</h3>
      <p>E portfolios can be introduced to learners for assessment purposes but  their use with learners should be viewed long term beyond the life of your  training program. Initially consider using e-porfolios for assessment of  learning objectives. Trainer feedback can be integrated back into the portfolio  and treated as an artifact to demonstrate skills and competencies to future  third parties, including potential employers. <br />
Support  interaction and dialougue with your learners in the e-portfolio around these  learning activities and products: </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Learners</strong> create, store artifacts and reflections, and organize their  work, preferably with hyperlinks </li>
      <li><strong>Trainers</strong> to review the work and  provide feedback in narrative form (<a href="http://projects.edtech.sandi.net/staffdev/tpss99/rubrics/rubrics.html">based  on a rubric, if available</a>).&nbsp; Explore <a href="http://www.rubrics101.com/rubricshellc.cfm?gcid=12&mode=gallery&sms=publicrub&xsite=rubric101">these  examples here.</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The trainer needs to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be clear on the competencies, generic skills,       and performance criteria that need to be demonstrated. Items within the       portfolio should have the potential to demonstrate these competencies. </li>
      <li>Ensure that guidelines for the development,       compilation and submission of portfolios are clearly stated. </li>
      <li>Develop an electronic proforma or rubric that       will aid in the assessment of the portfolio. As each portfolio is likely       to be unique this is sometimes difficult to frame but is critical in       ensuring a fair and valid assessment process. The following website allows       the user to electronically develop a rubric. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technical notes</h3>
      <p>You will need to be able to  access some technology or software platform on which your learners can upload  and view their portfolio. This may involve the use of: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>a subject delivery system such as Blackboard,       Blackboard or Janison. Such systems often have an area such as <em>Student Presentations </em>where       learners can upload various files for viewing by their trainers and peers.       In addition, a trainer may set up an assessment task for submission of a       final report outlining the portfolio experience. </li>
        <li>a dedicated software package which specialises       in managing electronic portfolios </li>
        <li>trainers and learners may choose to create       websites to display portfolios. </li>
        <li>Social Networking sites, blogs, wikis,       RSS and other web 2.0 tools and software.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Skills</h3>
      <p>The trainer will need skills in  guiding and monitoring the process. In an online environment this monitoring  may take place via email or in the Learning Management System. </p>      <a href="portfolio.htm#top" class="xxsmall">Back to top</a></div>

	        </strong>The E-standards for Training project has  released a report on e-portfolio systems in the VET system. This report  specifically focuses on e-portfolios to support transitions between training,  other forms of learning, and employment. The study shows the potential for  e-portfolios to provide a systematic, electronic method for learners to record  and control access to evidence of their learning.<br />
