      <h1>Virtual worlds</h1>
      <p class="note"> Virtual worlds are online environments where multiple users can interact  together or with characters or interactive environments. Virtual worlds are  immersive 3D environments where users have a great deal of freedom in terms of  where they go and who the can interact with. Users participate in the world  through the control of an avatar or online persona. An Avatar allows a user to choose how much of their real self they wish to portray in the virtual  world, potentially allowing them  to act as completely different people.</p>
      <div id="samples">
        <h2>Samples</h2>
        <p>Many of these samples will  require you to access and experience the virtual world &ldquo;<a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a>&rdquo;.&nbsp;  Instructions on how to do this are found in the Design Steps below.</p>

        <h2>Why include Virtual worlds?<br />
        </h2>
        <p>Virtual Worlds enable trainers to engage  learners in an experiential environment that can take on a variety of  dimensions depending on the context of the training delivery. In <em>a</em><em>Virtual  World</em>learners can experiment, plan, solve problems,  negotiate, collaborate, evaluate, learn from mistakes and take risks, while  acquiring a wide range of life and employability skills, improved self-esteem  and learning in a real way. Learners can interact with environments and  personalities in ways that can be difficult to manage for a large group in  traditional training.&nbsp; Virtual World  envrioments&nbsp; are 3 dimensional, enabling  the learner to inhabit a character or &ldquo;avatar&rdquo; within which to explore and  engage with situations and environments from a variety of perspectives.</p>
        <p>Virtual worlds can provide opportunities for rich  sensory immersive experiences, authentic contexts and activities for  experiential learning, simulation and role-play, modelling of complex  scenarios, a platform for data visualisation and opportunities for  collaboration and co-creation that can not be easily experienced using other  platforms. </p>
        <h3>Features</h3>
        <p>Virtual Worlds are distinguished from other online spaces by sharing  the following characteristics:</p>

        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li><strong>Shared space.</strong> <br />
          The world allows many users to participate at once.&nbsp; Users can create and and inhabit highly detailed &lsquo;virtual selves&rsquo;       through the customisation of &ldquo;avatars&rdquo;. </li>
          <li><strong>Graphical user interface</strong>. <br />
            The world depicts space visually. </li>
          <li><strong>Immediacy.</strong> <br />
          Interaction takes place in real time. Users can move around their world       using their keyboard and/or special &lsquo;tools&rsquo; within the &lsquo;world&rsquo;. As well as       walking and running, avatars are able to fly and &lsquo;teleport&rsquo; to different       locations and environments in the world.</li>
          <li><strong>Interactivity.</strong> <br />
          The world allows users to alter, develop, build, or submit customized       content. Relatively easy-to-use       built-in building and scripting tools allow users to create almost any       object or any experience. Users generate all environmental and interactive       content. Often users can own the intellectual property of environments       they create. In addition, Audio and video can be streamed from the web and       played &ldquo;in-world&rdquo;. </li>
          <li><strong>Persistence.</strong> <br />
            The world's existence continues regardless of whether individual users are       logged in. </li>
          <li><strong>Community.</strong> <br />
          The world allows and encourages the formation of in-world social groups       like teams, friendship groups, learning cohorts, clubs, cliques,       housemates, or other purpose driven communities. The commercial       organisation that owns the Virtual World will require users to abide by       terms of service but will pursue a hands-off approach to governance, allowing users to self-govern       conduct in the virtual world </li>
        </ol>
          <p>Some  virtual worlds operate within a real &ldquo;in-world economy&rdquo;  with real money transfer that enables the buying and selling of environmental  creations (including virtual &ldquo;land&rdquo; within the world). Users are free to profit  from these transactions. </p>

          <p>There are a number of virtual  worlds but 3 popular worlds include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>2nd Life - </strong><a href="http://www.secondlife.com/" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://www.secondlife.com/</a><br />
              Students and educators can work together on the Second  Life Grid from anywhere in the world as part of a globally networked virtual  classroom environment.<strong> </strong><br />

        <h2>Integrating Virtual worlds </h2>
        <p>There are two main aspects to using Virtual Worlds in learning:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learners using the world for collaboration or to access content such as  lectures, demonstrations, simulations and experiences. </li>
          <li>Trainers, and Learners develop &ldquo;in world&rdquo; creative and technical skills  to construct elements in the worlds and share them with others. These worlds,  then, are not just engaging, but provide a space for higher-level  collaboration, simulation, testing of hypotheses, interaction, creativity and  performance.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Other opportunities for using Virtual Worlds include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Distance and Flexible Education<br />
            Learners and Trainers can meet in-world to share information and resources via  slides, audio and video, engaging in discussions, presentations, group projects  and explorations.</li>
          <li>Presentations, Panels and Discussions<br />
            Virtual Worlds ability to establish a sense of presence, shared space and  shared experience makes it ideal for presentations, panels and discussions.  Presenters can show slides and videos and stream their voices into the world.</li>
          <li>Training and Skills Development <br />
            Virtual World platforms allows trainers to develop a range of strategies and  spaces for training and skills development. </li>
          <li>Self-paced Tutorials<br />
            The in-built building and scripting tools in Virtual Worlds allow for the  creation of sophisticated self-paced tutorials</li>
          <li>Displays and Exhibits <br />
            Learners and Trainers can create displays and exhibits. Using images, text and  multimedia users can create interactive displays and exhibits that avatars can  move in and interact with. </li>
          <li>Immersive Exhibits<br />
            Learners can engage in, experience and respond to information in context,  allowing for a deeper understanding of places, situations or circumstances.</li>
          <li>Role Plays and Simulations<br />
            Learners can undertake a range of role-plays and simulations, practicing real  life skills in a virtual space or exploring situations that they could not  undertake safely or easily in the real world.</li>
          <li>Exhibitions <br />
            Virtual Worlds host a range of Libraries, Art Galleries  and Museums where Learners can engage in events, discussions, and displays on a  wide range of topics. </li>
          <li>Historical Experiences<br />
            Virtual World users have created a range of environments based on historical  places and events. These environments can be used for a range of learning  activities including role-plays, action learning and research and historical  study.<br />
          </li>

            Choose a basic set-up for the appearance of your new avatar. There are a number  of male and female options on the website to choose from. Choose some basic  features and continue exploring &ndash; you can modify these later.</li>
          <li><strong>Complete the Registration Form</strong> </li>
          <li><strong>Download and install the Second Life client:</strong> You will need to  download and install the Second Life software onto their computer. (About 30MB  for Windows users and 62MB for Mac users). You must have this software  installed in order to access Second Life. </li>
          <li><strong>Log in to Second Life and Start Exploring:</strong> <br />
            Launch the Second Life software and login. You will arrive on Orientation Island  where you will be able to use the resources there to familiarise with the  Second Life interface. </li>
          <li><strong>Familiarisation<br />
        </strong>Play and explore initially without too much thought  of your training plans. Immerse yourself in the environment as a learner and  visit and engage with as many sites as possible. Give yourself the space to familiarise yourself with the geography,  facilities, norms, values and other socio-cultural features. Explore as much of  Second Lifefirst hand as you can so you can confidently brief your  learners. </li>
          <li><strong>Make Time<br />
          </strong>You will need time to prepare yourself to learn and appreciate the potential of  Second Life for teaching and learning. It  takes time to become technically proficient in Second Life</li>
          <li><strong>Reflect<br />
            </strong>Reflect on your experience in Second Life and the lessons  for you as a learner in a virtual world.Consider the meaning of  your Second Life experiences and of your understanding of how this new world  works &ndash; its strengths and weaknesses, its attractions and dangers. </li>
      </ul>
        <p><strong>Getting started  in Second Life with your Learners</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure that learners are trained  in the use of <em>virtual world </em>software. Ensure that they are aware of the  processes to use to get assistance &ndash; possible training in <em>basic </em>troubleshooting  processes. Act as mentor and trouble shoot support through initial group forays  into Virtual Worlds to provide confidence in building an understanding of  operating &ldquo;in world&rdquo;</li>
          <li>Ensure clear vision/guidance as to  how many hours learners should engage per day/week. Ensure clear  vision/guidance as to where engagement should occur (home or educational  institution).</li>
          <li>Encourage learners to experiment  and interact with a variety of environments &ldquo;in world&rdquo;. Reflect on these  experiences to help support further experimentation or resistance to engaging  with new experiences.</li>
          <li>Discuss how &ldquo;in world&rdquo; experiences shape an understanding of themselves  and their sense and understanding of others in a variety of situations  especially physically, socially, and culturally. </li>
          <li>Provide  opportunities for learners to simulate engagement with a variety of social and  physical situations and provide questions and content to help them reflect and  learn from these simulations. </li>
          <li>Embed a  notion of adventure into your teaching activities by regularly providing new  places and new people to explore. Encourage learners to move around and express  themselves with a wide range of gestures. </li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Assessment      </h3>
        <p>Because of the wide number of personal and environmental variables  within a virtual world&nbsp; Assessment Tasks  need to be unambiguous. Develop clear assessment <em>guidelines </em>and provide  a clear assessment <em>outline </em>for your learners.</p>
        <p>Depending on the type of activity chosen, it would be possible to use  the virtual classroom for assessment of such activities as presentations of  project outcomes, debates, role plays, simulations, information collection,  engagement in problem solving activities. Ideally learners should know the  criteria by which their participation in the virtual world is going to be  assessed. </p>
        <p>The following rubric was developed to support Facilitators develop  learning and assessment experiences in Virtual Worlds:</p>

      <h3>Generic skills</h3>
        <p>Virtual Worlds  offer extremely rich and immersive opportunities to foster generic skills.  Generic skills which may be developed include:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>working in <strong>groups and teams</strong> (defining the roles in the team, crisis management, giving feedback to       other team members). Virtual World can enable groups to&nbsp; breakout to work on a task. </li>
          <li><strong>problem solving</strong> and offering solutions to issues posed in       discussions&nbsp; and simulations       (developing creative and innovative solutions, applying a range of       strategies to solve problems) </li>
          <li><strong>communication skills</strong> (using appropriate       language for the audience, persuading effectively, sharing information,       asking for clarification, agreeing and disagreeing) </li>
          <li>effective  use of <strong>a range of technologies</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
        <h3>Technical notes</h3>
        <p>Virtual Worlds can be  hungry users of bandwidth and computer memory. Platforms are continually being  updated on Virtual Worlds so updated client software may need to be downloaded and  installed regularly. Your computer may also require the installation of plug  ins to enable you to experience streaming audio and video from inside the  Virtual World.</p>
        <p>Determine your systems  capacity and connectivity to ensure a quality experience in virtual worlds. For  an example, here are the Technical System requirements for the using Second  Life - <a href="http://secondlife.com/corporate/sysreqs.php" title="Link opens in a new window" target="_blank" class="external">http://secondlife.com/corporate/sysreqs.php</a>.</p>
        <p>Accessibility &ndash; while the technology to allow vision  impaired people to enter is yet to be developed, Virtual Worlds provide  opportunities for people with physical disabilities to simulate full physical  functionality </p>
        <h3>Skills</h3>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Development of skills to enable you to participate, communicate,       interact and work in a virtual world </li>
        <li>development of teaching skills in Virtual Worlds (greeting       participants, asking questions and guiding the interactions/explorations,       encouraging all participants to be involved, encouraging experimentation       and interaction, reflection and de briefing, supporting, providing       technical assistance,) </li>
        <li>development of technical skills to manage the virtual world       sessions (assigning certain privileges, setting up environments,       developing activities) </li>
        <li>(potentially) acquiring the skills to shape and  build custom built environments, interactions and experience for your learners  in the virtual world. <br />
