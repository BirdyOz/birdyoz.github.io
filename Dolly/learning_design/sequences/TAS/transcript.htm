<h1>Certificate II in Business</h1>
<p class="note">TAFE Tasmania with Tasmanian Communities Online &ndash; John Tucker, Jon Paice </p>
<h2>1. Background</h2>
<p>
  Tasmanian Communities Online is a network  of 66 Online Access Centres recurrently funded and centrally supported through  Department of Education (Centre Support Unit)<br />
  Our Project in 2005 was called Embedding  Effective Local Learning Support for E-Learners in Rural Communities. The  project had a primary goal to create and trial a model of support for students,  especially those of mature age, who are re-entering education and training, in  their local community. <br />
  This involved building on an existing e-delivery partnership  between Online Access Centres, TAFE Tasmania, and the Department of Education to deliver a <em>Certificate II in Business</em> course locally with a  combination of e-learning, work experience and face to face coaching. </p>
<h2>2. Challenges </h2>
<p>  A major challenge  for us was to find a way to support learning in remote and disadvantaged  communities, especially for mature aged unemployed people and single parents  wanting to enter or re-enter the workforce. <br />
&ldquo;For many  potential learners, beginning study at a mature age or after having children is  daunting, especially for those in rural communities disadvantaged by isolation  and limited post secondary learning opportunities,&rdquo; Mr Norris.</p>
<h2>3. Solution: the model</h2>
<p>
  Our project model worked like this: in  partnership with TAFE Tasmania, Tasmanian Communities Online delivered  <em>Certificate II in Business</em> to students around Tasmania. TAFE provided course materials and  online support. The Centre Support Unit, which is a section of the Education  Department that manages the TCO Network, set up the model and provided support,  coordination and oversight of the arrangements. The local Online Access Centres  were the interface between TAFE and the students. <br />
  The model that we have developed supports  e-learning and enhances the capacity of the learner to be involved in Life-Long  Learning. &nbsp;<br />
At the most basic level our project  delivered a <em>Certificate II in Business</em> course chosen because, as well as  utilising eLearning in its delivery, it also introduces many prerequisite  e-learning skills. But we also had another set of learners, in the coordinators  of the Online Access Centres. Professional development supported through wikis  and discussion forums utilising EdNA Groups was important. These coordinators  were the facilitators of the STUDY CIRCLES which are the keystones for support  and personal growth of our e-learners. </p>
<h2>4. The course </h2>
<p>
  The course,  <em>Certificate II in Business Studies</em>, was offered to volunteers in Tasmanian  Online Access Centres.<br />
There are  12 units for the qualification. Four units were supported by hardcopy and CD-ROM  based resources.</p>
<p>Learning  activities for the other units were specifically designed to reflect the  typical activities of staff in an Online Access Centre. A minimum of 80 hours of  volunteer work activity in a centre over a period of no less than 12 weeks up  to 24 weeks was required to provide assessors sufficient opportunity to collect  evidence of workplace competence.</p>
<p>The course was supported by online forums,  discussions and email, as well as by face-to-face Study Circle groups.</p>
<p>Supporting learners in a face-to-face Study Circle was an integral part of the course  requirements for the students - having the dual purpose  of </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>providing a supportive environment and </li>
  <li>being a vehicle to present elements of the course for       assessment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Many of the disadvantages that are  attributed to distance or online learning can be overcome with local support  provided by the Study Circle  model and our Online Access Centres (or any local organisation with access to  PCs). <br />
    <strong>So  what are Study Circles? </strong><br />
  They are meetings where people sit, usually  in a circle and typically with a cup of tea and cake &ndash; because this is all  about making people feel comfortable and putting people in touch with others  like themselves.<br />
  <strong>What  Happens in a Study Circle? </strong><br />
  The topics that are discussed in a study  circle will vary widely from group to group but generally discussions will  gravitate to the course work that students are undertaking and may in some  cases occupy the entire session. And this is fine! However, the role of the  facilitator is to lead discussions to examine topics that will expand thinking  around &ldquo;how we learn&rdquo; and learning in general, such that, often the study circle  topics are independent of a particular course. Some of the topics discussed in  our groups included goal setting, learning styles, barriers to learning and  time management.</p>
<h2>5. Training and supporting the facilitators</h2>
<p>
A critical part of our project was to  provide support and training for the facilitators of the Study Circles with the  aim that facilitators would increasingly takes a back-seat role and the Study Circle become  self-managed. </p>
<p><strong>Online  support</strong></p>
<p>With our Centres spread across our state  maintaining contact and support for them are big issues. Thus for our project  we decided that EdNA Groups would provide us with a great platform to base our  communications especially as it is so easy to set up!</p>
<p>We used the Forums for communications  between our Study Circle Leaders and the Project facilitator (supported by  email and teleconferences). We also used them to generate new professional  discourse and to follow up from the face to face workshops that were conducted.</p>
<p>We used the built in Wiki facility to  record the progress of the project.</p>
<p>We used the calendar facility to promote  and keep track of project milestones and events.</p>
<p>And we used the file store to distribute  resources such as documents and web-links. </p>
<p><strong>Coordinator  qualifications</strong></p>
<p>In terms of coordinator or facilitator qualifications  then <em>Certificate IV in Training and Assessment</em> is highly desirable and we need to develop a model to enable ongoing training.&nbsp; So, in partnership with the Education  Department&rsquo;s Recognition Services which has RTO status our first group of  coordinators is undertaking the TAA. </p>
<p>We are currently developing a Moodle  website to manage and provide an online component to the course and this first  group in the future will become the trainers and assessors for other  coordinators undertaking the course around the state.</p>
<h2>6. Outcomes</h2>
<p>
  The outcomes for this project can be  divided into those for individuals and those for the community.<br />
For our target group, the unemployed over  45s and single parents, the outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>self awareness and confidence  as a learner, study skills and skills for e-Learning and business.</li>
</ul>
<p>For our Study Circle Leaders who are our  Online Access Centre coordinators the outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>increased self awareness and  skills as a lifelong learner, and</li>
  <li>skills in e-Learning, training  and assessment, coaching, mentoring and facilitating Study Circles.</li>
</ul>
<p>These individual outcomes translate to  outcomes for the whole community. For the eight communities involved in our  project the outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;new job skills in Business and IT,</li>
  <li>an avenue to further education,</li>
  <li>an online forum is now  available for community issues, particularly in relation to adult education,  and</li>
  <li>there are now be more people  with skills in leadership, facilitation and managing meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p>To date we are very happy with the progress  but if I was to identify one problem area I would say that it is the difficulty  part-time staff, our coordinators, have in finding time for the required  professional development.</p>
<p>There were fantastic outcomes for  individuals in our project but we like to think that our greatest achievement  has been the establishment of this model of support. In 2006 we have used the  knowledge we gained in this project to expand the model to our entire network. </p>
<p>For all Communities, this project is delivering  a model to build educational capacity and citizenship that will empower people  to make choices and take action.</p>
