                    that we practiced, even up to five years ago, are now no longer
                    considered
                      acceptable. For
                      example care of young children is seen much more as a partnership
                    between
                      the child care professional and the parent. The parent is not
                    only considered to be the &#8216;expert&#8217; on their child but needs
                      to be encouraged to be a genuine partner in the child&#8217;s

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This
              is certainly a very different view point from when I began my teaching
              career nearly 20 years ago.
                    At that
                    stage, the
                    teacher was the &#8216;expert&#8217; and guided the learning
                    experience. In order for students to acquire some of the competencies
                    needed
                    to be an effective partner with all families and colleagues,
                    I believe they
                    need to be immersed in situations that will help change and develop
                  attitudes.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> How
              does this all link to role-play? When deciding what to put in my part
              of this keynote, I had to reflect on my attitudes
                      to and
                      knowledge
                      of role-play.
                      As far as role-play goes I see myself as a babe in the woods.
                      I am extremely reluctant to use role-play in the classroom
              in a face-to-face
                      (f2f) situation.
                      I always found them contrived and find that my students usually
                      demonstrate
                      what I&#8217;m telling them I expect to see. My perception after being
                      involved in adult education now for 10 years, is that many students perceive
                      role-play as &#8216;acting&#8217; so they can act and react in ways they
                      perhaps wouldn&#8217;t in real life contexts. How do I know this? Usually
                      by watching students in their interactions while on work placement, or
                      even after they have graduated. They often do not show the behaviours and
                      skills they can so clearly demonstrate on paper or in f2f role-play. Basically,
                      I&#8217;ve got to the stage that I never use role-play in face-to-face
        situations.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> However
              the online role-play is a completely different ball game. The anonymity
              plus extended time frame of the whole experience
                        allows you
                        to become immersed
                        in the character in a way you do not seem to be able to do
                        in
                        a f2f class. The opportunity to reflect throughout the role-play
                        gives
                        participants the opportunity to truly develop attitudes and
                        have beliefs and attitudes
        challenged.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> In
              2002 I was a student in the Graduate Certificate in Facilitating
            and Managing e-Learning (FAMe), a nine month course that introduces
            learners
                to all major aspects of online facilitation. Within the module &#8216;Communication
                Online (COL) &#8211; Online Feedback&#8217; I was engaged in
                a role-play where I needed to respond to a learner&#8217;s concerns
        or issues within the forum. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
            first role-play was a situation where four students had supposedly
                put comments/questions. Each FAMe participant then had to choose
                  one of these virtual students and respond to their comments.
                  The &#8216;virtual
                student&#8217; then replied back to each of us with almost another
                question or more complex situation as does happen in real life.
                I then had to reply.
                In this experience I was role-playing myself in that I was able
                to practice my facilitation skills on a fictitious student, but
                got a real response
                back. Because I couldn&#8217;t actually see the person (i.e.
                another of my peers in a f2f class) I certainly felt that it
                was more real. </font></p>

                  investigate goal-based elearning in a role-play simulation which
                  modelled a complex

                a provincial
                    city. This learning strategy is highly immersive and engages

        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In
            <strong>Needle Stick</strong> I had taken on the role of the Principal, Bernard Knowles.
            Bernard had two agendas within the role-play. His
            <strong>public
                  agenda</strong> was
                  to foster debate around the issue of a Needle Exchange Program
                  (NEP), his
                  <strong>private agenda</strong> was that he found the whole issue repugnant
            and wanted to get the Needle Exchange Program as far away from the
                  school as possible.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within
            this role-play I had the opportunity to try a variety of strategies
            that I would have to use in real life
              such as
                    strategic questioning,
                    trying to lead an unwilling group and dealing with people
            with very diverse public
                    and private agendas. It was also very interesting to have
            to argue an opposite view to which I actually felt. What impact
                    does this have
                    on
                    the learner?
                    What did I learn? And more interestingly why didn&#8217;t
                    I feel that this could happen in a f2f situation?</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I
            found that as I was immersed in the role-play, my knowledge,
                      understanding and persona became much more complex and &#8216;bigger&#8217;.
                      The following is my journey through role-play.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Getting
            used to the technology</strong><br>
          The first challenge for me was learning new technical
          skills. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Two
            technology platforms were used for the Needle Stick role-play:</font></p>
        <ul>
          <li><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">WebCT
              for initial pre-role-play instructions, inductions, introductions,
                                  debriefing</font></li>
          <li><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fablusi&#8482; for the actual role
                                    -play</font></li>
        </ul>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Being
            used to another learning platform, I found WebCT quite a bit different.
            However, being a bit
            of a clicker, I just
                clicked around until I figured
                            out how to do it. The limitations of the technology
              can be very discouraging, but at the same time the sense of accomplishment
                      when
                        I figured out
                            how to do it was very satisfying. This is of course
              a
                huge consideration for
                            facilitators. If students are not familiar with the

            in character was at times difficult. Unfortunately my real

      away who I was
                    by giving information that would put me in context, eg. I
            think I said in
                    one of the discussions that I was taking the year 6 kids
            on an excursion so wouldn&#8217;t be around much. The only other
            person I knew in the simulation was working with me on another project
            and because of this
      knew that I
                    was actually going to Sydney on an excursion with my Diploma
      2 students. It obviously wasn&#8217;t a great leap for her to figure out
      who I was. I know I almost gave it away another time by mentioning I was
      going to
                    Sydney, which would have told everyone that I was probably

                      my interpretation. This also combined with the fact that
                      when I&#8217;m
                      unsure I do tend to become very formal and try to ensure

                      to speak. I felt that many of the others seemed much more

    We had a problem to solve which initially was
          a little unclear certainly to me. I found I went in and out of different

                  initially in the dark. I was reluctant to post again in case

    up the &#8216;right&#8217; answer
                  or statement. This is one of the main reasons I really embraced
    the idea of fostering debate within the community (my public agenda). By asking
                  the questions in the P &amp; C forum I was able to gauge people&#8217;s

              people&#8217;s hidden agenda&#8217;s was

                    much an open book. What you see is what you get. I tend to say
                    what I think and try to stand up for
                    my beliefs. However I am realising more and more many people
                    do not do this. As the principal of the school I also had a hidden
                    agenda that I
                    don&#8217;t think I managed to convey to the group. I was violently
                    opposed to the whole needle exchange program but personally felt
                    in the position
                    I was in I was unable to express it publicly. I tried to do this
                    by fostering debate within the community. This was one of Bernard&#8217;s
                    core roles. He was very keen to do this and did it quite well.
                    I don&#8217;t know that
                    it got anyone anywhere though. Because of this I was able to
                    practice strategic questions. This is a personal goal of mine
                    (Margaret not Bernard). I went
                    to this great workshop based on the work of Fran Peavey that
                    demonstrated the use of strategic questions. I&#8217;m trying
                    to use them within my work and personal contexts. (Work seems
                    to be easier than home I have to
                    say). One of the first questions to ask rather than &#8216;Why
                    don&#8217;t
                    you agree&#8217; is &#8216;what concerns you most about this
                    issue&#8217;.
                    It cuts to the central core of the matter. I was asked at thedebrief
                    why I didn&#8217;t sign the petition (a petition to stop the
                    needle exchange program. The major reason for this was that it
                    would have given away
            my private agenda very publicly very early on.</font></p>

                students with the anonymity and extended time frames. I&#8217;m unsure how it
                would go and if they could refrain from talking about it and making alliances
                outside of the online environment. However, I find the so called &#8216;soft
                skills&#8217; are the hardest to &#8216;teach.&#8217; I could see application
                in a number of modules associated with inclusive practices and aboriginal

          benefits of being a designer as learner</b></font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Several
              years ago I was a &#8216;content expert&#8217; for a children&#8217;s
              services online course. While designing the learning experiences for this
              course, I tried very hard to ensure that they were interactive. Now in
              hindsight, I can look at the experiences I designed as say they were interactive.
              But only within the technology. There was very little learner interaction.
              Now having been a participant in a number of different online experiences
              including web based role-play and the Graduate Certificate in Facilitating
              and Managing e-Learning, I firmly believe that designers need to be learners
              first and foremost. By being immersed in the learning experience, you can
              see what is working and what isn&#8217;t. I found the experiences that
              required me to work and collaborate with other learners certainly stand
              out in my mind much more than some of the purely read/write exercise.
              Thus if I had my time again, role-play, interactive forums and chats
              would feature
        much more widely in my content.</font></p>
