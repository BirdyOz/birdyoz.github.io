    <td><p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Personality</strong>&#8230; an
          interesting, perplexing and complex phenomena. What is its importance
          in the context
        of web-based role-play for learning? As one who has taken on numerous
        personalities in the pursuit of exciting online learning experiences,
        I think I have a good idea of the answer to this question&#8230; but
        I&#8217;m sure that you do too, and maybe your answer is different to
        mine &#8211; based on your own experiences.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Consider
      this quote from an online learner surfacing from a role-play experience:</font></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><em>&#8220; Taking
              on a whole new persona was really challenging for me initially,
              but after a few times online I really started to get in to the
          role. So much so that I was sad to leave it behind at the end!&#8221;</em></font></p>
      </blockquote>      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If
          you&#8217;re designing a web-based role-play for learning, what considerations
            do you need to make concerning the role of personality when developing
            the role-profiles for the players? Experience has shown us that a &#8216;properly
            prepared role-profile&#8217; needs to include not only the black and white
            elements of each role, but also the various coloured hues and personal
            touches that individuals bring to the experience. Then of course there
            are those pesky questions to answer, like;</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Is it true that role-play really only works with those who are inclined
              to be extroverted actor types&#8230; or is this a myth? </font></li>
        <li><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Can the responsibility of taking on a different persona/personality for
                the purpose of role-play actually be detrimental to the learning process? </font></li>
        <li><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Is there an &#8216;ideal&#8217; personality type and/or learning style
                  for web-based role-play? </font></li>
      </ul>      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> I
          have used role-play in a number of learning settings &#8211; in the early
                days of course it was all face-to-face and generally as part of structured
                learning in areas such as communication, teamwork and interpersonal skills.
                Now my learners include professional teaching staff, leaders and managers,
                mature-aged students and school-leavers &#8211; a diverse audience indeed &#8211; and
                my course delivery/design projects range from entry-level vocational
                courses through to higher education and professional development.
                My challenge
                now is to integrate more web-based role-play into my online teaching,
                and to design engaging learning experiences that appeal to all
                the senses whilst
                catering for a wide range of personalities and learning styles.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000066" size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> As
          Marie has mentioned in her introduction, we are all still learning
          about the application and effectiveness of web-based
                  role-play
                  in online learning.
                  Since the success of a role-play experience depends almost
          entirely on the people participating, it&#8217;s important that we share our stories
                  and experiences so that we can all join in the onward and upward march
                  towards this seriously fun way of learning online. In the forum, you will
                  be able to read more about our experiences with personality in web-based
                  role-play, and meet some of the characters that we have inhabited from
      time to time.</font></p>      </td>
